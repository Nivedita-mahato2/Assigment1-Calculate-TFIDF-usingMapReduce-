<p>The drag and drop works for the reordering.  The position value updates in the DB for the QuestionMembership objects and the page actually shows the reorder correctly.  The problem is that on a page reload, it defaults back to whatever order it feels like.  I think it defaults to the question id for the order instead of the question_membership position, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how I can make it actually order on the initial render by the position field of the QuestionMembership?</p>

<p>I need to create 32 Bit numbers (signed or unsigned doesn't matter, the highest bit will never be set anyway) and each number must have a given number of Bits set.</p>

<h2>Naive Solution</h2>

<p>The easiest solution is of course to start with the number of zero. Within a loop the number is now increased by one, the number of Bits is counted, if the count has the desired value, the number is stored to a list, if not the loop just repeats. The loop is stopped if enough numbers have been found. Of course this works just fine, but it's awfully slow once the number of desired Bits gets very high.</p>

<h2>A Better Solution</h2>

<p>The simplest number having (let's say) 5 Bits set is the number where the first 5 Bit are set. This number can be easily created. Within a loop the first bit is set and the number is shifted to the left by one. This loop runs 5 times and I found the first number with 5 Bits set. The next couple of numbers are easy to create as well. We now pretend the number to be 6 Bit wide and the highest one is not set. Now we start shifting the first zero bit to the right, so we get 101111, 110111, 111011, 111101, 111110. We could repeat this by adding another 0 to front and repeating this process. 0111110, 1011110, 1101110, etc. However that way numbers will grow much faster than necessary, as using this simple approach we leave out numbers like 1010111.</p>

<p>So is there a better way to create all possible permutations, a generic approach, that can be used, regardless how many bits the next number will have and regardless how many set bits we need set?</p>

The first area that I am concentrating is the attendance area for the teachers to report attendance (and some other data) about the kids. This needs to be fast.</p>

<p>I've created a dual-control set up where the user clicks on the icon and via Javascript and Jquery I pop up the second control. Then I use a __doPostBack() to refresh the pop up control to load all of the relevant data.</p>

<p>Here's a little video snippet to show how it works: <a href=""http://www.screencast.com/users/cyberjared/folders/Jing/media/32ef7c22-fe82-4b60-a74a-9a37ab625f1f"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.screencast.com/users/cyberjared/folders/Jing/media/32ef7c22-fe82-4b60-a74a-9a37ab625f1f</a> (:21 and ignore the audio background).</p>

<p>It's slower than I would like at 2-3 seconds in Firefox and Chrome for each ""popping up"", but it's entirely unworkable in IE, taking easily 7-8 seconds for each time it pops up and loads. And that disregards any time that is needed to save the data after it's been changed.</p>

<p>Here's the javascript that handles the pop-up:</p>

<pre><code>function showAttendMenu(callingControl, guid) {
var myPnl = $get('"" + this.MyPnl.ClientID + @""')
if(myPnl) {
    var displayIDFld = $get('"" + this.AttendanceFld.ClientID + @""');
    var myStyle = myPnl.style;
    if(myStyle.display == 'block' &amp;&amp; (guid== '' || guid == displayIDFld.value)) {
        myStyle.display = 'none';
    } else {
        // Get a reference to the PageRequestManager.
        var prm = Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance();

        // Unblock the form when a partial postback ends.
        prm.add_endRequest(function() {
            $('#"" + this.MyPnl.ClientID + @""').unblock({ fadeOut: 0});
        });

        var domEl = Sys.UI.DomElement;
        //Move it into position
        var loc = domEl.getLocation(callingControl);
        var width = domEl.getBounds(callingControl).width;
        domEl.setLocation(myPnl, loc.x + width, loc.y - 200);

        //Show it and block it until we finish loading the data
        myStyle.display = 'block';
        $('#"" + this.MyPnl.ClientID + @""').block({ message: null, overlayCSS: { backgroundColor:'#fff', opacity: '0.7'} }); 

        //Load the data
        if(guid != '') { displayIDFld.value = guid; } 
        __doPostBack('"" + UpdatePanel1.ClientID + @""','');
    }
}}
</code></pre>

<p>First, I don't understand why the __doPostBack() introduces such a delay in IE. If I take that and the prm.add_endRequest out, it's VERY speedy as no postback is happening.</p>

<p>Second, I need a way to pop up this control and refresh the data so that it is still interactive. I'm not married to an UpdatePanel, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do it with a Web Service/static page method. As you can see this control is loaded many times on the same page so page size and download speed is an issue.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate any ideas?</p>

<p>Edit: It's the same in IE 6 or 7. I'm thinking it has to do with IE's handling of the UpdatePanel, because the same code is much faster in FF and Chrome.</p>

<p>I realize there are no real callbacks in Java.</p>

<p>Here's my approach, is there a library which already does this stuff? Feel free to suggest improvements, too.</p>

<p>Register call to Scheduler passes:</p>

<ul>
<li>a time specification containing hour, minute, second, year month, dom, dow, where each item may be unspecified, meaning ""execute it every hour / minute etc."" (just like crontabs)</li>
<li>an object containing data that will tell the calling object what to do when it is notified by the Scheduler. The Scheduler does not process this data, just stores it and passes it back upon notification.</li>
<li>a reference to the calling object</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon startup, or after a new registration request, the Scheduler starts with a Calendar object of the current system time and checks if there are any entries in the database that match this point in time. If there are, they are executed and the process starts over. If there aren't, the time in the Calendar object is incremented by one second and the entreis are rechecked. This repeats until there is one entry or more that match(es). (Discrete Event Simulation)</p>

<p>The Scheduler will then remember that timestamp, sleep and wake every second to check if it is already there. If it happens to wake up and the time has already passed, it starts over, likewise if the time has come and the jobs have been executed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, ASP.NET does not use impersonation, and your code runs using the ASP.NET application's process identity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I have the following web.config</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;

    &lt;appSettings/&gt;
    &lt;connectionStrings/&gt;

    &lt;system.web&gt;
        &lt;!-- 
            Set compilation debug=""true"" to insert debugging 
            symbols into the compiled page. Because this 
            affects performance, set this value to true only 
            during development.
        --&gt;
        &lt;compilation debug=""true"" defaultLanguage=""c#"" /&gt;
        &lt;!--
            The &lt;authentication&gt; section enables configuration 
            of the security authentication mode used by 
            ASP.NET to identify an incoming user. 
        --&gt;
        &lt;authentication mode=""Windows""/&gt;
        &lt;identity impersonate=""false""/&gt;
        &lt;!--
            The &lt;customErrors&gt; section enables configuration 
            of what to do if/when an unhandled error occurs 
            during the execution of a request. Specifically, 
            it enables developers to configure html error pages 
            to be displayed in place of a error stack trace.

        &lt;customErrors mode=""RemoteOnly"" defaultRedirect=""GenericErrorPage.htm""&gt;
            &lt;error statusCode=""403"" redirect=""NoAccess.htm"" /&gt;
            &lt;error statusCode=""404"" redirect=""FileNotFound.htm"" /&gt;
        &lt;/customErrors&gt;
        --&gt;
    &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So it seem impersonation is disabled just like <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms998351.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the article</a> is suggesting.</p>

<p>My aspx is blank default and the codebehind is</p>

<pre><code>namespace TestWebapp
{
    public partial class _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(String.Format(""Before1: Current Princupal = {0}"", Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name));
            WindowsImpersonationContext ctx = WindowsIdentity.Impersonate(IntPtr.Zero);
            try
            {
                int a = 0;
                System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(String.Format(""After: Current Princupal = {0}"", Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name));
            } finally
            {
                ctx.Undo();
            }

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I reload the page I get the following debug output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[5288] Before1: Current Princupal =
  DOMAIN\User
  [5288] After: Current Princupal =
  DOMAIN\User</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Output is the same with</p>

<pre><code>&lt;identity impersonate=""false""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The web site uses Default Application Pool and the pool is set up to use NETWORK SERVICE account for its worker processes.
I'm sure the application uses the web.config it should use and the w3p.exe worker process is running under NETWORK SERVICE.</p>

<p>What can be wrong in this case?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>@Edit: Rob, thanks for the tip! 
The $user shortcut shows me that everything is happening as I expect: with impersonation on I have the process running user NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE    and the thread has DOMAIN\User before WindowsIdentity.Impersonate(IntPtr.Zero) and ""No Token. Thread not impersonating."" after.
But Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name and HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Name still give me DOMAIN\User in both places.</p>

<p>@Edit: I've found out that to get Thread.CurrentPrincipal and HttpContext.Current.User changed I have to manually do it:</p>

<pre><code>Thread.CurrentPrincipal = new WindowsPrincipal(WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent());
HttpContext.Current.User = Thread.CurrentPrincipal;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure what's the point here, but anyway. I now have a problem with sharepoint shared services manage user profile permission but that's another question.</p>

<p>What is different between implementing a compiler and an interpreter?</p>

<p>To me a compiler is made up of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lexer</li>
<li>Parser (which builds the syntax tree)</li>
<li>Generate Intermediate code (like 3 address code)</li>
<li>Do all these crazy things to optimize if you want :-)</li>
<li>Generate ""assembly"" or ""native code"" from the 3 address code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, obviously, the interpreter also has the same lexer and parser as the compiler.<br>
But what does it do after that?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Does it ""read"" the syntax tree and execute it directly? (kind of like having an instruction pointer pointing to the current node in the tree, and the execution is one big tree traversal plus the memory management for the call stack) (and if so, how does it do it? I'm hoping the execution is better than a huge switch statement that checks what type of node it is)</p></li>
<li><p>Does it generate 3 address code and interpret that? (if so, how does it do it? Again, I'm looking for something more elegant than a mile long switch statement)</p></li>
<li>Does it generate real native code, load it into memory, and make it run? (at which point I'm guessing it's not an interpreter anymore, but more like a JIT compiler)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, at which point does the concept of ""virtual machine"" cut in? What do you use a virtual machine for in a language? (to be clear about my level of ignorance, to me a virtual machine is VMWare, I have no idea how the concept of VM applies to programming languages / executing programs).  </p>

<p>As you can see, my question is quite broad. I'm mostly looking for not only which method is used but mostly to first understand the big concepts, and then get into how it works in detail. I want the ugly, raw details. Obviously, this is more a quest for references to things to read rather than expecting you to answer all these details in here.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>
Daniel</p>

<p>EDIT: Thank you for your answers so far. I realized my title was misleading though. I understand the ""functional"" difference between a compiler and an interpreter.<br>
What i'm looking for is the difference as to how you <em>implement</em> an interpreter, vs a compiler.<br>
I understand now how a compiler is implemented, the question is how an interpreter differs from that.</p>

<p>For example: VB6 is clearly both a compiler and an interpreter. I understand now the compiler part. However, I can not grasp how, when running inside the IDE, it could let me stop the program at any arbitrary point, change the code, and resume execution with the new code.
That's just one tiny example, it's not the answer i'm looking for. What i'm trying to understand, as I explain below, is what happens after I have a parse tree. A compiler will generate new code from it in the ""target"" language. What does an interpreter do?</p>

<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

Unless there is some circuitry to manage and dispatch interrupts to the appropriate processor?

<p>A secondary concern has been using a modern ORM in the middle tier.  Our first choice has always been Entity Framework, mainly because the developers like to work with it.  (They love the LiNQ support.)</p>

<p>So here's the problem:</p>

<p>With peer-to-peer replication in mind, I settled on using uniqueidentifier with a default value of newsequentialid() for the primary key of every table.  This seemed to provide a good balance between avoiding key collisions and reducing index fragmentation.</p>

<p>However, it turns out that the current version of Entity Framework has a <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/dsimmons/pages/ef-faq-entity-services.aspx#Section_17"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very strange limitation</a>: if an entity's key column is a uniqueidentifier (GUID) then it cannot be configured to use the default value (newsequentialid()) provided by the database.  The application layer must generate the GUID and populate the key value.</p>

<p>So here's the debate:</p>

<ol>
<li>abandon Entity Framework and use another ORM:

<ul>
<li>use NHibernate and give up LiNQ support</li>
<li>use linq2sql and give up future support (not to mention get bound to SQL Server on DB)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>abandon GUIDs and go with another PK strategy</li>
<li>devise a method to generate sequential GUIDs (COMBs?) at the application layer</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm leaning towards option 1 with linq2sql (my developers really like linq2[stuff]) and 3.  That's mainly because I'm somewhat ignorant of alternate key strategies that support the replication scheme we're aiming for while also keeping things sane from a developer's perspective.</p>

<p>Any insight or opinion would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>After thinking about this and not finding any solutions from answers or via the Internet, I went ahead and moved my entire solution to my C:\ drive vs. my G:\ drive (both are local).  Doing this fixed my compile problem for some reason.</p>

<p>My question is, why does this work, and what is happening?  I have a guess, and I tried to prove it by looking at IL, but I'm only kidding myself if I think I can break down IL.  But my guess is, auto properties work by having the compiler generate fields for your properties behind the scenes.  Those fields cannot be accessed through code, all setting and getting must be done through the properties.  When creating a struct, a default constructor cannot be explicitly defined.  So behind the scenes, the compiler must be generating a default constructor that sets the values of the fields that the developer can't see.</p>

<p>Any and all IL wizards are welcome to prove or disprove my theory.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>The Idea is to notify the user using the memo when a packet is received/sent in a TCP Client.</p>

<p>After couple of fixes,the most suitable solution seemed to be this one</p>

<pre><code>    public string TextValue
    {
        set
        {
            this.Memo.Text += value + ""\n"";
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>That's how it's being called</p>

<pre><code>    var form = Form.ActiveForm as Form1;
    if(form != null)
        form.TextValue = ""Test asdasd"";
</code></pre>

<p>However,calling the code throws an exception ,because of Unsafe thread call.I found a solution at <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171728.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">msdn</a>,but I can't seem to acquire the method they've used there.</p>

<p>This is my remake,which doesn't work.</p>

<pre><code>    private void SetTextMemo(string txt)
    {
        if(this.Memo.InvokeRequired)
        {
            this.Invoke(SetTextMemo,txt); //error here

        else
        {
            this.Memo.Text += txt + ""\n"";
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>errors:</p>

<p>Argument '1': cannot convert from 'method group' to 'System.Delegate'</p>

<p>Argument '2': cannot convert from 'string' to 'object[]'</p>

<p>Basically,I'm trying to access the Memo(or more likely said,add text to the memo) from another thread using Invoke.I never used it before,maybe that's why I misunderstand my mistake.</p>

<p>Say for e.g. you have about 10000 records and this data gets populated when the page loads and this happens in chunks of say 100 records per webservice request.</p>

<p>To enable editing on these rows what approach would you follow.</p>

<p>Just to give an example say the object model for the fictitious scenario is given below.</p>

<p>List customers;   // list of customers</p>

<p>customers = ServiceFacade.GetAllCustomers(pageSize, currentPage);</p>

<p>Assume the above service calls brings back 50 records based on the pageSize displaying 10 records per page.</p>

<p>This will be bound to the gridView as below.</p>

<p>gridCustomers.DataSource = customers;
gridCustomers.DataBind();</p>

<p>Some points I would think of is outlined below and requires experts inputs...</p>

<ul>
<li>Disable viewstate for gridview (as this will slow down the performance of the page).</li>
<li>Use session object to persist the change (OR what would you recommend.  Is two way binding really helpful here, I don't know as I haven't tried it.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your ideas/suggestions are greatly appreciated.  I understand I could be flamed for this, but I think the good old DataSet may be useful here (as it has all the essential information which enables tracking changes etc).</p>

    flowLayoutPanel1.Controls.Add(new PersonButton(row));

flowLayoutPanel1.ResumeLayout();

<p>The developers assure me they had good reason for all the empty catch blocks, that sometimes the try with empty catch blocks are just there to ignore useless exceptions and keep the application from crashing.  I feel this is a cop out and complete BS.  Some of the examples I actually looked up were database calls where the record was being saved to the database, and in this case, if an exception was ignored, the user would get back an okay prompt, think everything was okay, and continue on with their work.  In reality, their work was never saved.  I think this is absolutely the most horrible kind of error.  In this case, they are completely wrong in throwing that code in a try with an empty catch block.  But my question is, ""Is this EVER acceptable in ANY situation?""

<p>I figured that the <code>array_unique</code> is somewhat O(n^2 - n) and here's my implementation:</p>

<pre><code>function array_unique2($array) 
{ 
    $to_return = array(); 
    $current_index = 0;

    for ( $i = 0 ; $i &lt; count($array); $i++ ) 
    { 
        $current_is_unique = true; 

        for ( $a = $i+1; $a &lt; count($array); $a++ ) 
        { 
            if ( $array[$i] == $array[$a] ) 
            { 
                $current_is_unique = false; 
                break; 
            } 
        } 
        if ( $current_is_unique ) 
        { 
            $to_return[$current_index] = $array[$i];
        } 

    } 

    return $to_return; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>However when benchmarking this against the <code>array_unique</code> i got the following result:</p>

<p>Testing (array_unique2)... Operation took 0.52146291732788 s. </p>

<p>Testing (array_unique)... Operation took 0.28323101997375 s.</p>

<p>Which makes the array_unique twice as fast, my question is, why ( Both had the same random data ) ?</p>

<p>And a friend of mine wrote the following:</p>

<pre><code>function array_unique2($a)
{
    $n = array();
    foreach ($a as $k=&gt;$v)
        if (!in_array($v,$n))
            $n[$k]=$v;
    return $n;
}
</code></pre>

<p>which is twice as fast as the built in one in php.</p>

<p>I'd like to know, why?</p>

<p>What is the time-complexity of array_unique and in_array?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
I removed the count($array) from both loops and just used a variable in the top of the function, that gained 2 seconds on 100 000 elements!</p>

The table uses a class that formats and creates TableRows and TableCells which we can call RowCreator. So MyTable calls rowCreator.CreateRow() and gets back a TableRow with a lot of goodies in it.</p>

<p>In this TableRow there is a TextBox which is supposed to trigger a javascript method on the onblur event, which is added by the RowCreator class.</p>

<p><code>textBox.Attributes.Add(""onblur"", ""javascriptMethod('"" + textbox.ClientID + ""');"");</code></p>

<p>I've also tried created a subclass of textBox which implements a method that adds the onblur event:</p>

<p><code>Attributes.Add(""onblur"", ""javascriptMethod('"" + this + ""');"")</code></p>

<p>Which doesn't work. The ID is just the namespace of the textbox subclass.</p>

<p>And the JavaScript method is very simple: </p>

<p><code>function javascriptMethod(boxId) {
       alert(boxId);
}</code></p>

<p>The trouble is, and I'm guessing this is because the textbox control hasn't been added to the control collection yet, that the boxId isn't the proper client ID. It is the same as the server side ID. Is there a way of getting the proper ID without having to add the row using Controls.Add on the page first? Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>The reason I'm even doing this is to read the textbox contents from a javascript function whenever it's been changed. Maybe there's a better way to do this?</p>

<p>---<strong>SubSite1</strong> = navigation set at ""Display the current site, the navigation items below the current site, and the current site's siblings""</p>

<p>---<strong>SubSite2</strong> = navigation set at ""Display the current site, the navigation items below the current site, and the current site's siblings""</p>

<p>-----<strong>Heading1</strong> = navigation set at ""Display the same navigation items as the parent site""</p>

<p>SiteMapProvider configuration:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;PublishingNavigation:PortalSiteMapDataSource ID=""SiteMapDS"" Runat=""server""
SiteMapProvider=""CurrentNavSiteMapProvider"" EnableViewState=""true""
StartFromCurrentNode=""true"" ShowStartingNode=""false""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The expected and actual behavior of the Quick Launch menu displayed at SubSite1 is:</p>

<p>---SubSite1</p>

<p>-----Heading1</p>

<p>-------Page1</p>

<p>-------Page2</p>

<p>-----Heading2</p>

<p>---SubSite2</p>

<p>The expected behavior of the menu after navigating to Heading1 of SubSite2:</p>

<p>---SubSite1</p>

<p>---SubSite2</p>

<p>-----Heading1</p>

<p>What I actually see after navigating to Heading1 of SubSite2:</p>

<p>---SubSite1</p>

<p>-----Heading1</p>

<p>-------Page1</p>

<p>-------Page2</p>

<p>-----Heading2</p>

<p>---SubSite2</p>

<p>-----Heading1</p>

<p>This does not match what I expect to see if I set the Heading1 navigation to ""Display the
same navigation items as the parent site"" and SubSite2 is set to ""Display the current site, the navigation items below the current site, and the current site's siblings"". I expect
Heading1 to inherit the navigation item of SubSite2 with the SubSite1 items collapsed from view. I've also played with the various

<p>The problem is python seems to break it into several stages. tp_new, tp_init and tp_alloc for creation and tp_del, tp_free and tp_dealloc for destruction. However c++ just has new which allocates and fully constructs the object and delete which destructs and deallocates the object.</p>

<p>Which of the python tp_* methods do I need to provide and what must they do?</p>

<p>Also I want to be able to create the object directly in c++ eg ""PyObject *obj = new MyExtensionObject(args);"" Will I also need to overload the new operator in some way to support this?</p>

<p>I also would like to be able to subclass my extension types in python, is there anything special I need to do to support this?</p>

<p>I'm using python 3.0.1.</p>

<p>EDIT:
ok, tp_init seems to make objects a bit too mutable for what I'm doing (eg take a Texture object, changing the contents after creation is fine, but change fundamental aspects of it such as, size, bitdept, etc will break lots of existing c++ stuff that assumes those sort of things are fixed). If I dont implement it will it simply stop people calling __init__ AFTER its constructed (or at least ignore the call, like tuple does). Or should I have some flag that throws an exception or somthing if tp_init is called more than once on the same object?</p>

<p>My current project is a large-ish public site (2 million pageviews per day) site running a mixture of asp classic and asp.net with a SQL Server 2005 back-end. We're heavy on reads, with occasional writes and virtually no updates/deletes. Our pages typically concern a single 'master' object with a stack of dependent (detail) objects. </p>

<p>I like the idea of returning all the data required for a page in a single proc (and absolutely no unnecesary data). True, this requires a dedicated proc for such pages, but some pages receive double-digit percentages of our overall site traffic so it's worth the time/maintenance hit. We typically only consume multiple-recordsets from our .net code, using System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDataReader and it's NextResult method. Oh, yeah, I'm not doing any updates/inserts in these procs either (except to table variables).</p>

<h2>The question</h2>

<p>SQL Server (2005) procs which return multiple recordsets are working well (in prod) for us so far but I am a little worried that multi-recordset procs are my new favourite hammer that i'm hitting every problem (nail) with. Are there any multi-recordset sql server proc gotchas I should know about? Anything that's going to make me wish I hadn't used them? Specifically anything about it affecting connection pooling, memory utilization etc.</p>

Command format of GPRS packets are as follows:

From server to tracker:

From tracker to server: 
$$\r\n

Note: 
Do NOT input ‘’ when writing a command. 
All multi-byte data complies with the following sequence: High byte prior to low byte. 
The size of a GPRS packet (including data) is about 100 bytes

Item        Specification
@@          2 bytes. It means the header of packet from server to tracker. 
            It is in ASCII code (Hex code: 0x40)

$$          2 bytes. It is the header of packet from tracker to server.
            It is in ASCII code (Hex code: 0x24)

L           2 bytes. It means the length of the whole packet including 
            the header and ending character and it is in hex code

ID          7 bytes, ID must be digit and not over 14 digits, the unused byte 
            will be stuffed by ‘f’ or ‘0xff’. It is in the format of hex code.
            For example, if ID is 13612345678, then it will be shown as 
            follows: 0x13, 0x61, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x8f, 0xff.
            If all 7 bytes are 0xff, it is a broadcasting command. ID is in hex code

command     2 bytes. The command code is in hex code. Please refer to the 
            command list below.

data        Min 0 byte and max 100 bytes. See Annex 1 for description of ‘data’.

<p>This pinned my CPU at 100% for more than 10 minutes and was steadily eating memory. I killed it before it used up all of swap. Am I doing something wrong or is CairoPlot just broken?</p>

<p>Further edit:</p>

<p>I now have something more workable using CairoPlot, based loosely on the above code. However, it's not perfect because of the resolution: I may need up to tens of nanoseconds (1e-8) resolution in order to catch some of the shorter pulses. For a multi-second graph, this takes a <em>very</em> long time with this method.</p>

<p>I know that theoretically the answer is yes. I also created demo applications and changed the lookandfeel even at runtime and it worked. But when I created a real application with lots of controls lookandfeel change was not really working:</p>

<ul>
<li>Different lookandfeels have different bugs (or strange features). For instance some of them creates the same style for JTextField and JFormattedTextField, some of them uses different styles. This change can be quite annoying for users.</li>
<li>Control sizes are not the same (using different fonts, different borders), so sometimes the window looks ugly after change.</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts can also be different.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>In my applications after lookandfeel change (actually instead of changing the lookandfeel I tried using the same lookandfeel with different skins) I always have to modify the application. Not a very big modification, but lots of small modifications which makes lookandfeel change difficult.</p>

<p>Am I just very unlucky with the lookandfeels I tried (currently using <a href=""http://www.l2fprod.com/skinlf/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">skinlf</a>), or lookandfeel change is not that easy as in small demo applications?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I'm using Swing and changing to other GUI library is not possible for me right now.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE2</strong>: It seems to me the question was not clear. I do know how to change the lookandfeel. My questions is: Is it possible to create a real application where changing lookandfeel (or the skin of the lookandfeel) is an easy task? Currently if I change the lookandfeel it is not enough to change 2 or 3 lines, I have to review the whole application and fix quite  a few problems caused by the lookandfeel change. dhiller suggested replacing skinlf with a better lookandfeel. Can you show me a skinable lookandfeel where skin replacement works better?</p>

<p>In older node modules (mostly those which came to see the light prior to ES6), which may be installed using the npm, such as <code>express</code>, usually no default export is defined.</p>

<p>My IDE (WebStorm) marks the following line with the <em>Default export is not declared in the imported module</em> notification.</p>

It is inconsistent, it happens in different pages, but it happens often enough that it is a big problem.  I should mention that it is not a true hang as described below.</p>

<p>My first thought was that the animations of some buttons was the problem since they are used on most pages, but after removing them the hangs still occur, although seemingly a bit less often.  I have tried to break into the debugger when the hang occurs; however there is never any code to view. No code of mine is running.  I have also noticed that the ""hang"" is not complete.  I have code that lets me drag the form around (it has no border or title) which continues to work.  I also have my won close button which functions when I click it.  Clicking on buttons appears to actually work as my code runs, but the UI simply never updates to show a new page.</p>

<p>I'm looking for any advice, tools or techniques to track down this odd problem, so if you have any thoughts at all, I will greatly appreciate it.</p>

<a href=""http://www.example.com/sub1/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.example.com/sub1/</a></p>

<p>The server-side code typically used to tell you what URL the user is at, looks like:
<a href=""http://#cgi.server_name##cgi.script_name#?#cgi.query_string#"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://#cgi.server_name##cgi.script_name#?#cgi.query_string#</a></p>

<p>however, ""cgi.script_name"" automatically includes the default cfm file for that folder-  eg, that code, when parsed and expanded, is going to show us ""<a href=""http://www.example.com/sub1/index.cfm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.example.com/sub1/index.cfm</a>""</p>

<p>So, whether the user is visiting sub1/index.cfm or sub1/, the ""cgi.script_name"" var is going to include that ""index.cfm"".</p>

<p>The question is, how does one figure out which URL the user actually visited?  This question is mostly for SEO-purposes-  It's often preferable to 301 redirect ""/index.cfm"" to ""/"" to make sure there's only one URL for any piece of content-  Since this is mostly for the benefit of spiders, javascript isn't an appropriate solution in this case.  Also, assume one does not have access to isapi_rewrite or mod_rewrite-  The question is how to achieve this within ColdFusion, specifically.</p>

<p>""The easiest way to prove that some new problem is NP-complete is first to prove that it is in NP, and then to reduce some known NP-complete problem to it""</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that I understand this:  If I have a problem, I can show that it is NP-Complete if I: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>show that it is in NP (a solution to
the problem can be verified in
polynomial time on a
non-deterministic Turing machine)</p></li>
<li><p>Show that a problem already known to be NP-Complete can be
'reduced' to the new problem</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, my question is, how were the first NP-complete problems 'proven' to be NP-complete?  At one time, the set of known NP-complete problems must have been zero, and this would have made it impossible to resort to step 2 in the above process.  </p>

<p>This makes me think that there is a different method for proof which I'm not aware of.  Either that, or maybe the whole NP-complete property is 'assumed' for certain problems due to lack of a known polynomial time solution. (actually, having written this, I wouldn't be surprised if this is the case, but I'd like some guru-feedback either way). </p>

"568719","1","570392","","2009-02-20 08:25:16","","19","5570","<p>As is well known, in XHR (aka AJAX) web applications no history for your app is build and clicking the refresh button often moves the user out of his/her current activity. I stumbled upon location.hash (e.g. <code>http://anywhere/index.html#somehashvalue</code>) to circumvent the refresh problem (use location.hash to inform your app of it's current state and use a page load handler to reset that state). It's really nice and simple.</p>

<p>This brought me to thinking about using location.hash to track the history of my app. I don't want to use existing libraries, because they use iframes etc. So here's my nickel and dime: when the application page loads I start this:</p>

<pre><code>setInterval(
       function(){
           if (location.hash !== appCache.currentHash) {
               appCache.currentHash = location.hash;
               appCache.history.push(location.hash);
               /* ... [load state using the hash value] ... */
               return true;
           }
           return false;
       }, 250
 );
</code></pre>

<p>(<em>appCache</em> is a predefined object containing application variables) The idea is to trigger every action in the application from the hash value. In decent browsers a hash value change adds an entry to the history, in IE (&lt;= 7) it doesn't. In all browsers, navigating back or forward to a page with another hash value doesn't trigger a page refresh. That's where the intervalled function takes over. With the function everytime the hash value change is detected (programmatically, or by clicking back or forward) the app can take appropriate action. The application can keep track of it's own history and I should be able to present history buttons in the application (especially for IE users).</p>

<p>As far as I can tell this works cross browser and there's no cost in terms of memory or processor resources. So my question is: would this be a viable solution to manage the history in XHR-apps? What are the pros and cons?</p>

<p>Update: because I use my homebrew framework, I didn't want to use one of the existing frameworks. To be able to use location.hash in IE and having it in it's history too, I created a simple script (yes, it's needs an iframe) which may be of use to you. I published it <a href=""http://www.nicon.nl/hash2history/"" rel=""noreferrer"">on my site</a>, feel free to use/modify/critizise it.</p>

<p>Given two variables, <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, find the type of <code>foo</code>.  (It is not known at development time, as this is generic code.)  Then, attempt to convert <code>bar</code> to whatever type <code>foo</code> is.  If this cannot be done, throw an exception.</p>

"709617","1","","","2009-04-02 13:04:57","","6","5572","<p>I'm trying to re-use my ASP User Controls in other projects, and have hit upon a problem. I've read ScottGu's post on <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/08/28/423888.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/08/28/423888.aspx</a> and tried to follow his patterns but run-time the child controls of my controls are not being initialised.</p>

<p>My setup: 
I'm using Visual Studio 2008 
I've created a solution to hold the controls I want to distribute to several other solutions. This solution contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>library projects (for model code, etc.), let's call this <em>""ClassLibrary""</em></li>
<li>a WebApp project (with my User Controls), let's call this <em>""Innermost""</em></li>
<li>a number of other WebApp projects acting as Shells for the Innermost project, let's regard one of them and call it <em>""Outer""</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The thought behind this is that Innermost contains the functionality and Outer contains any special modifications needed to make Innermost -controls work in a particular framework.</p>

<p>The ClassLibrary has code like this (this is all from a demo-setup I made to make sure it was an ASP issue, not something else I was doing):</p>

<pre><code>using System;

namespace ClassLibrary {
    public class LibraryClass {
        public long getLong() {
            return DateTime.Now.Ticks;
        }

        public string getString() {
            return DateTime.Now.ToString();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Innermost references the library project and works fine. This is an example of a UserControl in this project:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Control Language=""C#"" AutoEventWireup=""true"" 
    CodeBehind=""WebUserControl1.ascx.cs"" 
    Inherits=""Innermost.UserControls.WebUserControl1"" %&gt;
&lt;asp:Label ID=""testLabel"" runat=""server""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>with code-behind: </p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Web.UI;
using ClassLibrary;

namespace Innermost.UserControls {
    public partial class WebUserControl1 : UserControl {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
            LibraryClass c = new LibraryClass();
            testLabel.Text = ""Your number is "" + c.getLong();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a test page in the Innermost project which uses the User Controls of the Innermost project by registering them with the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Page Language=""C#"" AutoEventWireup=""true"" CodeBehind=""Test1.aspx.cs"" 
    Inherits=""Innermost.Test1"" %&gt;

&lt;%@ Register TagPrefix=""inner"" TagName=""Control1"" 
    Src=""~/UserControls/WebUserControl1.ascx"" %&gt;
&lt;%@ Register TagPrefix=""inner"" TagName=""Control2""
    Src=""~/UserControls/WebUserControl2.ascx"" %&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" 
    ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""&gt;
&lt;head runat=""server""&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form id=""form1"" runat=""server""&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Control 1:
    &lt;inner:Control1 ID=""control1"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    Control 2:
    &lt;inner:Control2 ID=""control2"" runat=""server"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Outer project references Innermost and ClassLibrary; and contains UserControls with the following registering of the Innermost controls:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Control Language=""C#"" AutoEventWireup=""true"" 
    CodeBehind=""TopControl.ascx.cs"" Inherits=""Outer.Control.TopControl"" %&gt;
&lt;%@ Register TagPrefix=""inner"" Assembly=""Innermost""
    Namespace=""Innermost.UserControls"" %&gt;
&lt;inner:WebUserControl1 ID=""Control1"" runat=""server""/&gt;
&lt;inner:WebUserControl2 ID=""Control2"" runat=""server""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With a simple code-behind:
    using System;
    using System.Web.UI;</p>

<pre><code>namespace Outer.Control {
    public partial class TopControl : UserControl {
        public bool ShowType1 { get; set; }

        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
            Control1.Visible = ShowType1;
            Control2.Visible = !ShowType1;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I run the test-page in the Innermost project I get no errors, and everything works. When I run the Outer project I get <code>NullReferenceException</code>s telling me that the child controls of the <code>Innermost.UserControls.WebUserControlX</code> have not been set.</p>

<p>StackTrace:</p>

<pre><code>[NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.]
   Innermost.UserControls.WebUserControl1.Page_Load(Object sender, EventArgs e) in c:\Test\ASP\Innermost\Innermost\UserControls\WebUserControl1.ascx.cs:9

   System.Web.UI.Control.LoadRecursive() +141
   System.Web.UI.Page.ProcessRequestMain(Boolean includeStagesBeforeAsyncPoint, Boolean includeStagesAfterAsyncPoint) +627
</code></pre>

<p>I can provide the test setup as solutions if anyone wants to have a closer look at this.</p>

<p>So, finally, my question is: Why do the ChildControls of the controls not get set up as expected? Even if I run <code>CreateChildControls()</code> in the Init of the outer controls they aren't being created. Is there some particular way I need to compile the Innermost project for use in the Outer project?</p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>For 2, I understand that this is a case of negative binomial because it says ""until 2,3,4 heads occur in sequence"" . But I am not sure how to proceed to write the code in R or come up with the logic.</p>

<p>For 3, I am guessing have to calculate the number of heads got in 100 runs, run lengths of heads. But what does it imply to set <em>different seeds</em>? I am unsure of that.</p>

<p><strong>note</strong> This is a homework problem, yes (I am not able to tag it so). I do not need the code, just some pointers/ corrections/clarifications/suggestions would help. </p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> For simulating 2, I tried out the following code on MATLAB - </p>

<pre><code>head_count = 0;
flip_count = 0;

while (head_count &lt; 3)                  #counting for 3 multiple heads
    flip = rand(1);
    flip_count = flip_count+1;
    if (flip &gt; 0.5)
        head_count = head_count + 1;
    else 
         head_count = 0;       #invalidate head counts if not successive.
    end
end
disp(flip_count)

<p>Please let me know if this logic is correct. And I can recreate it using R.</p>

What we're finding is that an row that contains ""foo"" 10 times but does not contain ""bar"" will have a much higher rank then an row that that has both ""foo"" and ""bar"".
  We would want the row that has both terms to be preferred over a row that only has one term multiple times.  Any advice on how to achieve this?</p>

<p>I have found documentation related to a RANKMETHOD modifier, but that seems to be for SQL Enterprise search only, and not available on regular SQL Server 2005 installs.  We could also switch to Lucene.Net, but I would hope to verify it has the better ranking available.  We might also do multiple searches and merge the results, but that seems undesireable as the number of words searched for increases.</p>

<p>Some more information that might help:  This is caused by a user control that is being hosted in a content management system (Umbraco), which might have something to do with why the viewstate is being passed to the page (as the control is contained within a greater page in the CMS).

This data changes every day in different ways at each different location. I need a way to keep this data up-to-date and synced between all these locations.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>In one location someone places a set of images on their local server. In another location, someone else places a group of documents on their local server. A third location adds a handful of both images and documents to their server. In two other locations, no changes are made to their local servers at all. By the next morning, I need the servers at all five locations to have all those images and documents.</p>

<p>My first instinct is to use rsync and a cron job to do the syncing over night (1 a.m. to 6 a.m. or so), when none of the bandwidth at our locations is being used. It seems to me that it would work best to have one server be the ""central"" server, pulling in all the files from the other servers first. Then it would push those changes back out to each remote server? Or is there another, better way to perform this function?</p>

<p>If you investigate the IL generated from the code below, you can clearly see that the casted assignment isn't doing the same thing as the converted assignment. In the former, you can see the boxing/unboxing occurring; in the latter you can see a call to a convert method. </p>

<p>I know in the end it may be just a silly  semantic difference--but is casting just another word for converting. I don't mean to be snarky, but I'm not interested in anyone's gut feeling on this--opinions don't count here! Can anyone point to a definitive reference that confirms or denies if casting and converting are the same thing?</p>

<p>rp</p>

<p>Note added after Matt's comment about explicit/implicit:</p>

<p>I don't think implicit/explicit is the difference. In the code I posted, the change is explicit in both cases. An implicit conversion is what occurs when you assign a short to an int.</p>

<p>Note to Sklivvz:</p>

<p>I wanted confirmation that my suspicion of the looseness of Jesse Liberty's (otherwise usually lucid and clear) language was correct. I thought that Jesse Liberty was being a little loose with his language. I understand that casting is routed in object hierarchy--i.e., you can't cast from an integer to a string but you could cast from custom exception derived from System.Exception to a System.Exception. </p>

<p>It's interesting, though, that when you do try to cast from an int to a string the compiler tells you that it couldn't ""convert"" the value. Maybe Jesse is more correct than I thought! </p>

<p>Please note that I have already asked a similar question regarding the Xcode debugger <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/582412/xcode-debugger-code-window-does-not-match-stack-window"">here</a>, but I am reposting since I just learned that this is in fact not Xcode's fault, but a problem with GCC / ld / GDB.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> My project makes use of the following third-party libraries: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_DirectMedia_Layer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SDL</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boost_C%2B%2B_Libraries"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Boost</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxWidgets"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wxWidgets</a>. I am not sure if this matters for this problem, but I just wanted to mention it just in case it does. </p>

<p>I've tried compiling an Xcode SDL project template and did not experience the same problem, so it must be due to something special in my project.</p>

<p><strong>Second Edit</strong>: As I just found out, I made a mistake while searching files with the string ""This is an automatically generated"". I just found several dozen files with the same string, all belonging to <a href=""http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FreeImage</a>, one of the third party libraries I am using. So, the problem seems to be related to FreeImage, but I am not still not sure how to proceed.</p>

<p>I like Linq to Sql and the idea of expressing data access logic (or CRUD operations in general) in your native development tongue rather than having to deal with the ""impedance mismatch"" between C# and SQL.  For example, to return an ObjectDataSource-compatible list of Event instances for a business layer, we use:</p>

<pre><code>return db.Events.Select(c =&gt; new EventData() { EventID = c.EventID, Title = c.Title })
</code></pre>

<p>If I were to implement this using old SQL-to-C# constructs, I'd have to create a Command class, add the EventID parameter (using a string to describe the ""@EventID"" argument), add the SQL query string to the Command class, execute the command, and then use (cast-type)nwReader[""FieldName""] to pull each returned field value and assign it to a member of a newly created instance of my EventData class (yuck).</p>

<p>So, <em>that</em> is why people like Linq/SubSonic/etc. and I agree.</p>

<p>However, in the bigger picture I see a number of things that are wrong.  My sense is that Microsoft also sees something wrong and that is why they are <a href=""http://codebetter.com/blogs/david.hayden/archive/2008/10/31/linq-to-sql-is-dead-read-between-the-lines.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">killing Linq to SQL</a> and trying to move people to Linq to Entities.  Only, I think that Microsoft is <em>doubling-down on a bad bet.</em></p>

<p>So, what is wrong?</p>

<p>The problem is that there are <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">architecture astronauts</a>, especially at Microsoft, who look at Linq to Sql and realize that it is not a true data management tool: there are still many things you cannot do easily of comfortably in C# and they aim to <em>fix it.</em>  You see this manifested in the ambitions behind Linq to Entities, blog posts about the <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/adioltean/archive/2005/09/13/465471.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">revolutionary</a> nature of Linq and even the <a href=""http://www.linqpad.net/Challenge.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">LinqPad challenge</a>.</p>

<p>And the problem with <em>that</em> is that it assumes that SQL is the problem.  That is, in order to reduce a mild discomfort (impedance mismatch between SQL and C#), Microsoft has proposed the equivalent of a space suit (full isolation) when a band-aid (Linq to SQL or something similar) would do just fine. </p>

<p>As far as I can see, developers are quite smart enough to master the relational model and then apply it intelligently in their development efforts.  In fact, I would go one further and say that Linq to SQL, SubSonic, etc. are <em>already too complex:</em> the learning curve isn't that much different from mastering SQL itself.  Since, for the foreseeable future, developers <em>must</em> master SQL and the relational model, we're now faced with learning <em>two</em> query / CRUD languages.  Worse yet, Linq is often difficult to test (you don't have a query window), removes us one layer from the real work we are doing (it generates SQL), and has very clumsy support (at best) for SQL constructs like Date handling (e.g. DateDiff), ""Having"" and even ""Group By"".</p>

<p>What is the alternative? Personally, I don't need a different model for data access like Linq to Entities.  I'd prefer to simply pop up a window in Visual Studio, enter and validate my SQL, and then press a button to generate or supplement a C# class to encapsulate the call.   Since you already know SQL, wouldn't you prefer to just enter something like this: </p>

<pre><code>Select EventID, Title From Events Where Location=@Location
</code></pre>

<p>and end up with an EventData class that A) contains the EventID and Title fields as properties and B) has a factory method that takes a 'Location' string as an argument and that generates a List&lt;EventData&gt;?  You'd have to think carefully about the object model (the above example obviously doesn't deal with that) but the fundamental approach of still using SQL while eliminating the impedance mismatch appeals to me a great deal.</p>

<p>The question is: am I wrong?  Should Microsoft rewrite the SQL infrastructure so that you don't have to learn SQL / relational data management any more?  <em>Can</em> they rewrite the SQL infrastructure in this way? Or do you think that a very thin layer on top of SQL to eliminate the pain of setting up parameters and accessing data fields is quite sufficient?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> I wanted to promote two links to the top because I think that they capture important aspects of what I am after.  First, CodeMonkey points out an article entitled <a href=""http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">""The Vietnam of Computer Science.""</a>  It takes a while to get started but is a very interesting read.

It isn't exactly on topic but it is close and is a great read.</p>

<p>Update 2: I've given the ""answer"" to ocdecio although there are many great answers here and the choice of the ""right"" answer is purely subjective. In this case, his answer squared with what I think is truly the best practice given the current state of technology.  This is an area that I fully expect to evolve, however, so things may well change.  I'd like to thank everyone who contributed, I've upvoted everyone who I think gave a thoughtful answer.</p>

<p>So: How do I go about <i>removing</i> singletons from existing code?</p>

<p>For example:<br>
In a retail store management program, I used the MVC pattern. My Model objects describe the store, the user interface is the View, and I have a set of Controllers that act as liason between the two. Great. Except that I made the Store into a singleton (since the application only ever manages one store at a time), and I also made most of my Controller classes into singletons (one mainWindow, one menuBar, one productEditor...). Now, most of my Controller classes get access the other singletons like this:</p>

<pre><code>Store managedStore = Store::getInstance();
managedStore.doSomething();
managedStore.doSomethingElse();
//etc.
</code></pre>

<p>Should I instead:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create one instance of each object and pass references to every object that needs access to them?
<li>Use globals?
<li>Something else?
</ol>

<p>Globals would still be bad, but at least they wouldn't be <a href=""http://misko.hevery.com/2008/08/17/singletons-are-pathological-liars/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pretending</a>.</p>

<p>I see #1 quickly leading to horribly inflated constructor calls:</p>

<pre><code>someVar = SomeControllerClass(managedStore, menuBar, editor, sasquatch, ...)
</code></pre>

<p>Has anyone else been through this yet? What is the OO way to give many individual classes acces to a common variable without it being a global or a singleton? </p>

<p>in  response to a question below: the information required to determine which controls to restore is contained in a dedicated viewstate object.</p>

<p>I am dynamically creating controls in the codebehind page - these controls are all hooked up to click handlers so when a postback occurs I must re-create the previous set of controls, then clear the controls down and generate the new set of controls based on the previous click.</p>

<p>This is coded and working correctly under normal circumstances esentially as follows:</p>

<pre><code>in Page_Load
if not postback generate default buttons 
else if postback re-generate buttons that were shown on last page

in click_handler
Clear the dynamically generated buttons created in the Page_Load
generate new buttons based on the specific click being handled

<p>With 100 users per second we start getting the exception:

array&lt;System::Byte&gt;^ css_keycode_shadow;

<p>So, I decided to <strong>start learning Python</strong>. Since I'm used to using PHP, I just started building pages by uploading an .htaccess file with:</p>

<pre><code>addtype text/html py
addhandler cgi-script .py
</code></pre>

<p>Then, my sample pages look like:</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python
print ""content-type: text/html\n\n""
print ""html tags, more stuff, etc.""
</pre>

<p>This works fine. But, I came across a comment in a post that said that <strong>CGI isn't the best way to use Python</strong>. Of course, it didn't mention what <em>is</em> the best way.</p>

<p><strong>Why is it that using CGI is not the best way to use Python? What is the alternative?</strong></p>

<p>Is there some <strong>totally other way</strong> to set up a simple Python site? Is there some completely different paradigm I should be looking at outside of .htaccess and .py files?</p>

I know you can use the clock() function to get cpu time, and multiply it by CLOCKS_PER_SEC to get actual time, but I'm told the clock() function is not well suited for this.</p>

<p>So far I have attempted this (a billion is to pause for one second)</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

#define BILLION 1000000000

int main()
{
 struct timespec rawtime;
 clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW, &amp;rawtime);
 unsigned long int current =  ( rawtime.tv_sec + rawtime.tv_nsec );
 unsigned long int end =  (( rawtime.tv_sec + rawtime.tv_nsec ) + BILLION );
 while ( current &lt; end )
 {
  clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW, &amp;rawtime);
  current =  ( rawtime.tv_sec + rawtime.tv_nsec );
 }

 return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know this wouldn't be very useful on its own, but once I've found out how to time correctly I can use this in my projects. I know that sleep() can be used for this purpose, but I want to code the timer myself so that I can better integrate it in my projects - such as the possibility of it returning the time left, as opposed to pausing the whole program.</p>

<p>I've been researching and experimenting, but I'm not fully understanding everything here. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>The user control for this example is a simple square with a circle inside of it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl x:Class=""CircleInSquare""
    xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
    xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"" Width=""100"" Height=""100"" &gt;
    &lt;Grid Background=""#000000""&gt;
        &lt;Ellipse Name=""Circle""
                 Margin=""10""
                 Fill=""?????????""
                 &gt;
        &lt;/Ellipse&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/UserControl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The VB Code Behind it:</p>

<pre><code>Partial Public Class CircleInSquare

    Private _CircleColor As Color

    Public Property CircleColor() As Color
        Get
            Return _CircleColor
        End Get
        Set(ByVal value As Color)
            _CircleColor = value
        End Set
    End Property

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>When I use this user control, how can I apply a CircleColor to the control, and have it be shown as the Ellipse's fill color? Even better... can I give it a default color that shows up in the VS2008 Designer?</p>

<p>So... if I place one of these into my window XAML like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;app:CircleInSquare CircleColor=""Blue"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I would like the circle to display as Blue (or any other color I choose for that instance)</p>

The project makes extensive use of unit testing and scripted UI tests. Initialy unit tests covered the system framework, business rules and state transitions (or workflow). Test scripts are used for black box testing. However, over time the cost of maintaining our full set of unit tests has become increasingly expensive especially those relating to state.</p>

<p>After a bit of investigation we have found that test scripts are more effective (that is, provide better coverage) and are cheaper to maintain than unit tests relating to workflow.

<li>put those elements into a dictionary comprised of dictionaries</li>
<li>the 1st dictionary contains location and the 2nd dictionary which is made up of the type of the item and how much it costs</li>

<p>For Example:</p>

<pre>
Location   Item     Cost

gymnasium  weights  15 

market     cereal   5

gymnasium  shoes    50

saloon     beer     3

saloon     whiskey  10

market     bread    5
</pre>

<p>Which would result in <pre>{'gymnasium': {'weights': 15, 'shoes': 50}</pre> and so on for the other keys</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
This is not homework, but a riddle posed on a <a href=""http://www.hacker.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">hacker.org</a>.

Using that VM is the difficult part, though of course made easier by an algorithm that is short and simple.</p>

- Avoiding manually creating a secondary view is the entire point of this, so using an ingenious way to display a read only version of the user interface that was built by hand using labels is wat I am trying to avoid.</p>

<p>Is it possible to have a working copy on a network available share (c:\svn\projects\website) that everyone (in this case 3 of use) can checkout and commit files to? We don't need a build server because it is an asp site and the designers are used to having immediate results when they save a file.

<p>An easy solution would be for all of us to use the same subversion username and that would at least allow me to put files under version control.</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm trying to take our current work flow, which is editing the LIVE version of a site using Frontpage Extensions or FTP. And move it to something BETTER. In this case a copy of the live site on a development server that I setup to mirror the live server, remove frontpage extensions access. Then the designers can still have the same effect of instant gratification but I will not have to worry they are editing the live files. Even using a shared user/pass in subversion is still version control. It may not be ideal and if the designers were actually programmers I would try to get them fully on board but that's just not the case.

Substance absolutely refuses to construct UI classes outside of the EDT. I've done plenty of Swing/AWT and I know most of the rules regarding the EDT. I use SwingWorker, SwingUtilties.invokeLater to modify components. I always though that components could be <strong><em>CONSTRUCTED</em></strong> outside of the EDT, but must be <strong><em>realized</em></strong> and <strong><em>manipulated</em></strong> on the EDT. In other words, you can construct and setup defaults in the background but the call to pack/setVisible must be EDT as well as any subsequent calls to manipulate the component.</p>

<p>The reason I ask is that I have a particularly ""beefy"" window to construct, involving many widgets, state, and resources (lots of icons). Previously, I constructed the window on the background method of a SwingWorker and made the window visible in the done method. Never had a single problem. Upon switching to Substance, the internal EDT checking bites me.</p>

<p>I've been able to refactor code to get around this. I can construct on the EDT which isn't a good solution since the entire application will block. I can also refactor even more and try my best to load all of the extra resources outside of the EDT.</p>

My only guess is that the XmlField Property has some sort of unique identifier on the heap and that by making a clone, you've assigned it a new unique identifier.  When Linq then generates the query, it doesn't even attempt to see if the field has been updated, since it has a new id, it simply write the value to the database.  But, I'm simply speculating and hope that someone else can provide a better understanding of what is going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: To address Jon's post, the reason for the issue (as it is explained on the MS Connect site) is that ""the XML field does not update because Linq-to-SQL doesn't handle the XElement.Changed event"".</p>

<p>For my implementation, the code that works ends up looking something like this:</p>

<pre><code>MyXElementProperty.SetElementValue(""Author"", author);

MyXElementProperty = new XElement(MyXElementProperty);
</code></pre>

<p>For reference (to anyone else that finds this question), the following also works:</p>

<pre><code>MyXElementProperty = new XElement(MyXElementProperty);

MyXElementProperty.SetElementValue(""Author"", author);

<p>We have over a thousand ""Classes"" written since 1998 in OO as far as it was available at the time. For the most part each class is its own include in SE38, with the class definition and implementation together in this include.</p>

<p>Up to now, we could successfully change and activate these classes <em>as long as the main program was pre-existing in 4.7</em>. Now we are trying to use one of these older classes in a new main program for regression test purposes, and we are getting the following error: </p>

<p><strong>""Within classes and interfaces, you can only use ""TYPE"" to refer to ABAP Dictionary types (not ""LIKE"" or ""STRUCTURE"").""</strong> </p>

<p><em>This error is valid as per the current definition of the SAP language.</em> </p>

<p>my understanding: 
UTF-8 is a superset of character encoding in which 0-127 are ascii characters.
So if in a UTF-8 string , a characters value is Not between 0-127, then it is not a ascii character , right? Please correct me if i'm wrong here.</p>

<p>On the above understanding i have written following code in C :</p>

Correct answer for the <strong>x√ab c</strong> is 1 ...i.e it has only 1 non-ascii character , but in above output it is coming as 3 (times Not ascii character).</p>

Thus, I want to do mydomain.com/:id (DELETE) and have it implicitly call my delete method.</p>

<p>Now, it's my understanding that if a browser (my browser is GWT RequestBuilder) doesn't support DELETE/GET, Rails somehow accomplishes this task with a POST and some other url parameter.  So, how can I accomplish this with a GWT RequestBuilder?</p>

<p>I have an MDI application (C#, Winforms, .NET 2.0, VS2005, DevExpress 8.2) and one of my forms is behaving very strangely - not repainting itself properly where it overlaps with another instance of the same form class.</p>

<p>The forms contain a custom control (which contains various DevExpress controls), and are inherited from a base form (which is itself inherited).</p>

<p>Due to issues with form inheritance (that old chestnut) there is a bit of control rearranging going on in the constructor. </p>

<p>Problem 1 (minor): None of this control repositioning/resizing seems to take effect unless the form is resized, so I nudge the width up and down by one pixel after the rearranging. Ugly, hacky and I'd really like to not have to do this.</p>

<p>Problem 2 (major): 
If forms are shown then attached to the MDI form using the API call SetParent, when I display the 2nd instance, various parts of the two forms are not correctly drawn where they overlap - bits of the top one are behind the existing one - and this problem gets worse when the forms are moved around, rendering them basically unuseable. Other child forms (if present) of a different type seem unaffected...</p>

<p>STOP PRESS: I've established that it doesn't have to be 2 instances of the child form. With only one there are still problems - mainly round the edges of the form, like the area that's being refreshed is smaller than the form itself.</p>

<p>The problem does not occur if the parent is set using the .MDIParent property of the child form - but we cannot do this as the form may be being displayed by a control hosted in a non-.Net application. Also I need to display the child forms non-maximised even if the existing children (of a different type) are maximised, and that only happens using SetParent.</p>

<p>I have tried Refresh() on all the forms of this type (I have a controller that keeps a list of them), but no joy. I have tried to reproduce this effect form a basic app with the same inheritance structure, but I can't. Clearly it is something about the form - since I recreated the form from scratch yesterday and it is still the same it must be the code - but what?? </p>

<p>I am not the hottest on form painting events etc. so have I missed something?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have an unsigned int NumViews field

<li><p>Have a separate table FrobViews

This doesn't involve any updates so can avoid table locking in MyISAM tables - however, the read performance will suffer if you want to display the number of views on each page.</p></li>

The tables involved don't really follow the traditional examples out there (product/orders), so I need some help getting started.

Each column contains some bit of info related to the case.  As the case is being processed, additional one-to-many tables are populated with events related to the case. There are quite a few of these event tables, example tables might be: (case-open, case-dept1, case-dept2, case-dept3, etc.). Each of these tables has a caseid which maps back to the ""cases"" table.

        }
    }
}


Function.prototype.bind = function( obj ) {
    var method = this;
    return function() {
        return method.apply( obj, arguments );
    }
}


// proxy.php - a dummy that keeps the XHR object waiting for a response
&lt;?php
$rand = mt_rand( 1, 10 );
sleep( $rand );
echo date( 'H:i:s' ).' - '.$rand;
</code></pre>

<p>I think the problem might be that you can't delete an object (xhr) from it's own event handler (process) as is the case here. especially because the 'this' within the handler is bound to an object (XHR) which contains the object (xhr) I'm trying to delete.
Kinda circular!</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>What is it about these nodes that makes them the exception in Internet Explorer?</strong>  Why is whitespace not inserted after these nodes, and is inserted in the others?  </p>

There is no free lunch! you can get the elegant way (accepted answer) but it still takes as long as the more expensive operation (i.e. counting all results). 
In real life, I will go with the 2 SQL approach, one to return top 1000 rows for display, and one that is ASYNC and updates some AJAX panel with the count(*) results that will take much much longer to computer</p>

I've been hunting through <a href=""http://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/wx_wxscrolledwindow.html#wxscrolledwindow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the wxWidgets documentation</a> and a load of examples from various sources on t'internet. Most of those seem to imply that a wx.ScrolledWindow should work if I just pass it a nested group of sizers(?):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most automatic and newest way is to simply let sizers determine the scrolling area.This is now the default when you set an interior sizer into a wxScrolledWindow with wxWindow::SetSizer. The scrolling area will be set to the size requested by the sizer and the scrollbars will be assigned for each orientation according to the need for them and the scrolling increment set by wxScrolledWindow::SetScrollRate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...but all the example's I've seen seem to use the older methods listed as ways to achieve scrolling. I've got something basic working, but as soon as you start scrolling you lose the child windows:</p>

        dc.DrawRoundedRectangle(0, 0,width, height, 8)

        self.sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.HORIZONTAL )

<li>HTTP only, HTTPS not needed</li>
<li>Preferably be able to serve a page from an in memory source. I want to integrate it into another app to be able to make changing data available via a browser, but I don't want to have to write it to a file on disk first.  For example, just pass it a C# string to use as the current page content.</li>
<li>Preferably open source so I can modify it if needed</li>
<li><em>Definitely</em> needs to be free... it's for a personal project with no budget other than my own time.  I also want to be able to release the final product that would use this library freely (even if that means complying to the particular OSS license of that library.</li>

<p>Edit: To clarify some more, what I need can be REALLY simple.  I need to be able to serve essentially 2 documents, which I would like to be served directly from memory.  And that's it.  Yes, I could write my own, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't doing something that was already available.</p>

<p>The problem is that it's using ""ewWaitUntilTerminated"" because we need to capture the exit code.  It's made a little worse by the fact that we're running it /passive /norestart so that it's less work on the user's part (Maybe we shouldn't?)</p>

<p>The easiest option I could think of is to hide the window while it's installing .NET and showing it again after it's done, but I'm not sure how to do that.  </p>

<p>The ideal solution would be to show a progress page, but it doesn't seem like it'd be possible since we'd need to return right away but somehow still be notified when the process exits and capture the exit code otherwise we'd just have an eternal progress bar.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to go about this?</p>

<p>Edit: Minimizing would probably be better, but not sure how to do that either.  We do display a message informing the user that the process may take 10-20 minutes, however the problem is that the main setup form is completely frozen, can't move, minimize or do anything with it.  Also running /passive the .NET installer doesn't actually show any progress for a good minute or two on a slower machine.</p>

I'm finding myself particularly busy this semester, managing various tasks and timelines between work and school. Further, I find myself running around between labs, work, home, libraries, etc. For these reasons I think a web based solution is ideal. Which leads to the question, do you have a recommended web based solution for task/project management for personal use? Ideal would be free (or nearly), and one which I could install on my server. Accounting is not a requirement, just management of time and tasks (gantt charts would be great). However, svn integration would be really good as I keep my school work in there.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I put a bounty on this, as a good solution would be very valuable to me (more so than the rep). The answers so far have been great, but none fit just right for personal use. Ideal would be something that manages files and time with something I could self host. It would be a plus for MAC+PC solutions as we use MAC OSX in the lab on campus. Currently SVN and a web based time manager seems to be the way to go.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>First, thank you for the great responses! FogBugz, Trac, and Request Tracker were either strongly recommended or suggested more than once. Trac and Request Tracker are also free and self hosted, however, their strengths seem to lay in team development. I’m going to give FogBugz on Demand a shot and see how that works out. I am also going to start using the Drop Box as suggested, great idea!  Further, SVN <strong><em>will</em></strong> be used for the longevity of ‘everything’.  This should walk around the 2 gig issue and self hosting desire. I am considering SVNNotifier for keeping machines current. Thanks again!</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>I have decided to use <a href=""http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FogBugz</a> as suggested by Zabbala.  As he said, it really does everything I want from task tracking to time management.  It’s an amazing and generous free offering from FogCreek.  Thank you everyone, I really appreciate all of the feedback.</p>

<p><strong>FOLLOWUP</strong></p>

<p>Just to follow up on this item. I have been using FogBugz for two weeks now; couldn’t be happier. I have started using <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B001AAN4PW"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LiveScribe’s SmartPen</a> in conjunction with FogBugz. I am keeping longer term items within FogBugz, and copy the current week’s items in a ‘journal’ for the road. The SmartPen makes digitizing the 'journal' painless.</p>

<p>For managing files I am using a mixture between FogBugz, DropBox, SVN, and Unison. I use DropBox to share across the net, say between home and the lab, and Unison to synch up the DropBox folder within the larger SVN working copy (not everything is in DropBox).</p>

<p><strong>LONG TERM FOLLOW UP</strong></p>

<p>I've been using fogbugz much less in favor of the LiveScribe's journal. Seems that the traditional pen and paper has an efficiency to it that's hard to beat. Regarding LiveScribe, I have had a few problems with it which has left me uncomfortable with their file format. Their files are obscured in both the naming convention and the format. If they had an open format I would feel much better about entrusting it with my data.</p>

<p><strong><em>LONGER TERM FOLLOW UP (3 YEAR+)</em></strong></p>

<p>I've switched to using wikimedia to document my work/time/research. For task management I have been using the Google app <strong><em>Insightly</em></strong>. The combination feels more natural and has 'stuck'. The wiki route is really useful... </p>

<p><strong>*EVEN LONGER TERM FOLLOW UP (7 YEAR+) *</strong></p>

<p>I've switched to using Trello boards for task management.  I've drifted away from using wikimedia after a mistake on my part caused the database to be lost.</p>

At first, my app.config serviceModel section looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;  
&lt;serviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabled=""false"" /&gt;  
&lt;behaviors&gt;  
    &lt;serviceBehaviors&gt;  
        &lt;behavior name=""MyDefaultServiceBehavior""&gt;

        &lt;/behavior&gt;  
    &lt;/serviceBehaviors&gt;  
&lt;/behaviors&gt;  
&lt;services&gt;  
    &lt;service behaviorConfiguration=""MyDefaultServiceBehavior"" name=""MyService""&gt;

    &lt;/service&gt;  
&lt;/services&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p> </p>

<p>This works fine in development when I was accessing the service running on my local machine. When I deployed it, the WSDL contained absolute paths that still pointed to localhost:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsd:import schemaLocation=http://localhost:8888/MyService?xsd=xsd0 namespace=""http://tempuri.org/"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, I can change the httpGetUrl in the app.config like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled=""true"" httpGetUrl=http://devserver1:8888/MyService /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And now the wsdl works correctly on that server. The problem is that I have to manually set the address in each app.config that gets deployed.</p>

<p>Is there a way to either:<br>
1. Have the wsdl already include everything so that there are no imports?<br>
or<br>
2. Use relative paths in the wsdl import statements?<br></p>

<p>Or any other suggestions would be appreciated. I have two development servers that the deployment is automated to, if only it weren't for this wsdl problem.</p>

<p>Since this is only for generating the proxy, I suppose I could generate the proxy and distribute it myself, but I'd rather let users generate the proxy themselves.</p>

<p>Thanks!

I've done some searching (both here, and in general), but can't find the answers (or even reasonable hints) to what I want to achieve (though, a few things come close-ish).</p>

<p>Basically, I'm trying to deserialize the data for the Google Chrome bookmarks file using the <a href=""http://james.newtonking.com/pages/json-net.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Json.NET library</a> (though, if there's a better alternative, I'm all for that - the documentation for this library is a little confusing in places).  I'm a little confused as to the next step to take, due primarily to being used to PHP's fantastic handling of JSON data (using <a href=""http://uk.php.net/json_decode"" rel=""noreferrer"">json_decode()</a>), allowing for a single function call, and then simple associative-array access.</p>

<p>The library (Json.NET) wants me to specify an Object type that it can deserialize the JSON data into, but I'm not really sure how to go about structuring such an Object, given the format of the Bookmarks file itself.  The format is something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>{
   ""roots"": {
      ""bookmark_bar"": {
         ""children"": [ {
            ""children"": [ {

               ""name"": ""Example URL"",
               ""type"": ""url"",
               ""url"": ""http://example.com""
            }, {
               ""date_added"": ""12880290253039500"",
               ""name"": ""Another URL"",
               ""type"": ""url"",
               ""url"": ""http://example.org""
            } ],
        ""date_added"": ""12880772259603750"",
            ""date_modified"": ""12880772452901500"",
            ""name"": ""Sample Folder"",
            ""type"": ""folder""
         }, {
            ""date_added"": ""12880823826333250"",
            ""name"": ""Json.NET"",
            ""type"": ""url"",
            ""url"": ""http://james.newtonking.com/pages/json-net.aspx"";
         } ],

         ""type"": ""folder""
      }
   },
   ""version"": 1
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in PHP, I'd be far more used to doing something along the lines of the following, to get the data I wanted, and ending up with 'Json.NET':</p>

<pre><code>$data['roots']['bookmark_bar']['children'][0]['name'];
</code></pre>

<p>I can work out, simply enough, what objects to create to represent the data (something like a root object, then a bookmark list object, and finally an individual bookmark object) - but I'm really not sure as to how to implement them, and then get the library to deserialize into the relevant objects correctly.</p>

<p>Any advice that can be offered would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>My thinking is that this would be useful for both developers and project managers: project managers like to have a fairly broad overview of what is going on, whereas developers need to drill down to the details, and very often need to divide a task into sub-tasks. This would also come in handy if someone put two issues into one ticket.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of an issue tracker which does this? So far the ones I've looked at (Trac, FogzBugz, and Basecamp) all have a flat organisation of tickets, so they're either useful for the developers or for the project managers but not for both. <a href=""http://www.assembla.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Assembla</a> does allow a ticket to have child tickets (and multiple parent tickets) but it doesn't do a very good job of usability on this specific feature.</p>

<p>If there is such an issue tracker, has anyone used it for both developers and project managers, and if so, how much success did you have with it? Alternatively, is there a better approach that can be usable by both categories of users?</p>

I am asking about bug trackers with a specific feature for a specific purpose, so please don't post your favourite bug tracker if it doesn't do what I've asked for.

<p>Ok so in the context of socket code, I can do this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The converse is not true. Casting a char* to a pointer of any type other than a char* and dereferencing it is usually in violation of the strict aliasing rule. </p>

<p>Does this mean that when I recv a char array, I can't reinterpret cast to a struct when I know the structure of the message:</p>

int main()

    // Ommiting make sure we have a complete message from the stream
    // but lets assume msgBuff[0]  has a complete msg, and lets interpret the msg

    // SAFE!?!?!?
    pointerToMsg = &amp;msgBuff[0];

    printf(""Got Msg: a: %i, b: %i"", pointerToMsg-&gt;a, pointerToMsg-&gt;b);

<p>The reason for the substr'ing is due to the URL being run through rawurlencode() elsewhere, and linking to http%3A%2F%2F makes the page think it is a local/relative link.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
I pasted the above response without really looking at it. So the HTML is correct when viewing source, but the actual page interprets it with another trailing slash after it.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
This was all a result of rawlurlencode(). If I decoded, or skipped the encoding all together, everything worked perfectly. Something about rawurlencode() makes the browser want to stick a trailing slash in there.</p>

<p>To clarify for those who fear that I'm treating non-identical code as if it were identical: as far as this part of the program is concerned, $val is a constant.

<p>I want the script to give me all the possible combinations that are then held against a database of stripped words. These stripped words just come from a dictionary and have all the letters I mentioned in my question stripped out of them. That way, the number to be encoded can usually easily be related to a one or more database records. And when that happens, you end up with a list of words that you can use to remember the number you wanted to remember.</p>

<p>I need to poll the database and based on a result, create a request to the database for more data, get the response and pass it to a group of ports, for which based on a promoted property, only one of the ports will act.</p>

<p>It looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XUZt2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XUZt2.jpg"" width=""620""></a>
</p>

<p>However, if you assign ""Temp Out"" to a send port group, the message is sent to all the ports in the group, irregardless of the filters set on each port.  From my understanding, this is expected behavior (read <a href=""http://www.biztalkgurus.com/forums/t/2236.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>).</p>

<p>So I explored other options such as using Content Based Routing (CBR sample) like in the SDK. You can view this <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms948408.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. </p>

<p>I tried this and completely removed the orchestration (its really not needed).  However, there are major routing/subscription errors, and upon further research, it appears that you can't do this if you have solicit-response ports.  Some articles on that <a href=""http://www.tech-archive.net/Archive/BizTalk/microsoft.public.biztalk.general/2006-02/msg00178.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.   I pretty much have the same issue <a href=""http://www.biztalkgurus.com/forums/t/5016.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> user does.</p>

<p>In the end it doesn't matter to me whether I use an orchestration or not.  However, I need a solution in which I can pass the message to multiple send ports, and I can have only one actually use the message and send.  This is needed so that I can edit and add ports easily without having to modify anything else or hard code decisions into the orchestration.</p>

<p>I'm not asking about executing queries using multiple CPUs simultaneously - I know this it possible.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>What I mean is something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are two 2 servers: <em>Server1</em> and <em>Server2</em></li>
<li>Both server host database <em>Foo</em> and both instances of <em>Foo</em> are identical</li>
<li>I connect to Server1 and submit a complicated (lots of joins, many calculations) query</li>
<li><em>Server1</em> decides that some calculations should be made on <em>Server2</em> and some data should be read from that server, too - appropriate parts of the query are sent to <em>Server2</em></li>
<li>Both servers read data and perform necessary calculations</li>
<li>Finally, results from <em>Server1</em> and <em>Server2</em> are merged and returned to the client</li>
</ul>

<p>All this should happen <strong>automatically</strong>, without need to explicitly reference <em>Server1</em> or <em>Server2</em>. I mean such parallel query execution - is it possible?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for the tips, John and wuputah.</p>

<p>I am researching alternatives of increasing <strong>both</strong> availability and capacity of MOSS database backend. So what I'm looking for is some kind out-of-the-box SQL Server load balancing solution that would be <strong>transparent to the application</strong>, because I <strong>cannot modify the application</strong> in any way. <strong>I guess SQL Server has no such feature</strong> (and Oracle, as far as I understand it, does - it is RAC mentioned by wuputah).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong></p>

<p>A quote from the <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.03.sqlclusters.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Top Tips for SQL Server Clustering</a> article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let's start by debunking a common
  misconception. You use MSCS clustering
  for high availability, not for load
  balancing. Also, SQL Server does not
  have any built-in, automatic
  load-balancing capability. You have to
  load balance through your
  application's physical design.</p>

The calling form used properties to avoid recreating the form each time (the form was just hidden instead of closed) and kept a dictionary of active forms to prevent the same form from being activated more than once. This looks like a modal form, supports multiple pop-up forms at once, but does not tie up the main GUI thread.</p>

<p>I need to iterate through the array and find the range (the largest value in the array minus the smallest value). However, there is a catch. I only want to find the range where the smallest and largest values are within 1,000 samples of each other.</p>

<p>So I need to find the maximum of: range(data + 0, data + 1000), range(data + 1, data + 1001), range(data + 2, data + 1002), ...., range(data + 3599000, data + 3600000).</p>

<p>I hope that makes sense. Basically I could do it like above, but I'm looking for a more efficient algorithm if one exists. I think the above algorithm is O(n), but I feel that it's possible to optimize. An idea I'm playing with is to keep track of the most recent maximum and minimum and how far back they are, then only backtrack when necessary.</p>

<p>I'll be coding this in C++, but a nice algorithm in pseudo code would be just fine. Also, if this number I'm trying to find has a name, I'd love to know what it is.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>To solve the in-use issue, I need to copy it first. I'm currently copying it directly from the remote machine to the local machine, and parsing it there. That leads to issue 2. Since the files are quite large copying it locally can take quite a while.</p>

1) How do i speed up the file transfer (Compression?, Is transferring locally even neccessary?, Can I read an in use file some other way?)
2) How do i deal with multi-line entries when splitting up the lines among threads?</p>

<li>What happens if the class doesn't explicitly extend EventDispatcher? Is there is some sort of magic that goes on in the compiler which essentially makes the class an EventDispatcher?</li>

<p>Thanks to Christophe Herreman for his illuminating answer. However, I have a few follow-ons from my questions above. I wonder if anyone could fill in the gaps for me (I tried to number these questions 4, 5, 6 but they show up 1, 2, 3 for some reason!)</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li><p>I've added the -keep option to the compiler and looked at the generated binding code. Could anyone explain how this code is applied? The compiler seems to generate a class called BindableProperty for each class, which contains the getter and setter. How does this get folded into the class I wrote? The feature looks kind of like partial classes in C# - is this exclusively behind-the-scenes compiler functionality, or is it something I could use myself?</p></li>
<li><p>The BindableProperty class still does not explicitly implement EventDispatcher, how does the generated class implement event dispatching?</p></li>
<li><p>In question 3, I asked about binding to static functions, but I actually meant static getter and setter functions. This doesn't seem to be allowed.</p></li>

<p>I have read that this is typically the fault of missing libraries. I know the C &amp; FORTRAN code compiles fine seperatly (respective libraries included) as does the C++ code when compiled on its own. This leads me to believe that it is the interface between the two programs that causes the error. Unfortunatly I've little to no experiance debugging this sort of problem and without any clues from the linker its hard to move forward. I'll include the necessary parts of my program that deal with the interface between the two sides of the program.</p>

<p>First the C++ part: SA.h, SA.cpp</p>

<p>SA.h:</p>

<pre><code>class SimAnneal {
    ...
    std::vector&lt;float&gt; DensityArray; 
    std::vector&lt;float&gt; EnergyArray;
  public
    double ObjFunction ();
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>SA.ccp:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;          
#include &lt;time.h&gt;           
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include ""SA.h""
#include ""CFE.h""
#include ""randomc.h""  //Includes mersenne.cpp

double SimAnneal::ObjFunction () 
{
    CFE(&amp;DensityArray[0], &amp;EnergyArray[0]); 

      // sends pointers of both arrays to CFE.c and modifies EnergyArray as 
      // shown in CFE.c

    double SumStrainEnergy = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; EnergyArray.size(); i++)
    {
        SumStrainEnergy += EnergyArray[i];  //Effectively sum of array 
                                                //engy[] from CFE.c
    }

    return SumStrainEnergy;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly the C/FORTRAN part: CFE.h, CFE.c</p>

<p>CFE.h:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef __cplusplus
extern ""C"" {
#endif 

void CFE(float density[], float energy[]);

#ifdef __cplusplus
 }
#endif 
</code></pre>

<p>CFE.c:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include ""BCs.h""
#include ""EMatrix.h""
#include ""Numbering.h""
#include ""KMatrix.h""
#include ""fg_types.h""
#include ""Solve.h""

void CFE(float density[], float energy[])
{
    ...stuff...

    float * dens;
    dens = density;  //pass pointer of array density[0] in SA.cpp to CFE.c

    ...more stuff....

    float * engy;
    engy = energy; //pass pointer of array energy[0] in SA.cpp to CFE.c

    ***Modify engy in some respects****    
}
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially the ObjFunction in SA.cpp is called in main.cpp, which contains main().</p>

<p>Is there any visible fault?</p>

<p>Is there any way I can ask the linker to announce what causes / where the error occours in the linking?</p>

<p>Any help will be much appriciated.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>This method is used by Importing (in VB.NET) System.Data.DataTableExtensions and then calling the method against an IEnumerable. You would do this if you want to filter a Datatable using LINQ, and then restore the DataTable at the end.</p>

<p>i.e:</p>

<pre><code>Imports System.Data.DataRowExtensions
    Imports System.Data.DataTableExtensions

    Public Class SomeClass
            Private Shared Function GetData() As DataTable
                Dim Data As DataTable

                Data = LegacyADO.NETDBCall


                Data = Data.AsEnumerable.Where(Function(dr) dr.Field(Of Integer)(""SomeField"") = 5).CopyToDataTable()


                Return Data

            End Function
    End Class
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, the ""WHERE"" filtering might return no results. If this happens CopyToDataTable throws an exception because there are no DataRows.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>The correct behavior should be to return a DataTable with Rows.Count = 0.</p>

<p>Can anyone think of a clean workaround to this, in such a way that whoever calls CopyToDataTable doesn't have to be aware of this issue?</p>

<p>System.Data.DataTableExtensions is a Static Class so I can't override the behavior....any ideas? Have I missed something?</p>

The library is written in C and was developed under Unix/Linux, and my application will run on Windows. It's a library of mostly mathematical functions, so as far as I can tell it doesn't use anything that's platform-dependent, it's just very basic C code. Also, it's not that big, less than 5,000 lines.</p>

<p>What's the easiest way to use the library in my application? I know there's JNI, but that involves finding a compiler to compile the library under Windows, getting up-to-date with the JNI framework, writing the code, etc. Doable, but not that easy. Is there an easier way? Considering the small size of the library, I'm tempted to just translate it to Java. Are there any tools that can help with that?</p>

<p><BR>
<strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I ended up translating the part of the library that I needed to Java. It's about 10% of the library so far, though it'll probably increase with time. C and Java are pretty similar, so it only took a few hours. The main difficulty is fixing the bugs that get introduced by mistakes in the translation.</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for your help. The proposed solutions all seemed interesting and I'll look into them when I need to link to larger libraries. For a small piece of C code, manual translation was the simplest solution.</p>

The only such interface I'm familiar with is the dialogue box found in Excel under data > sort, but this is rather clunky and does not yield itself to quick switching between views. I would much prefer an iTunes-style interface that allows quick sorting by clicking on column headers. However, such interfaces typically only allow sorting by one column (an exception is iTunes itself which has a very limited, apparently hard-coded ability to sort by ""Album by Artist"" and ""Album by Year"" by clicking on the Album header).</p>

<p>I can envision an interface where each column header has some numbers, such that clicking on 1 makes the column the primary sort key, clicking on 2 the secondary key, and so on. Alternatively, clicking (or right-clicking) on a column header could bring a drop-down menu with ""primary sort"", ""secondary sort"" etc. However, I've never seen such an interface implemented, and I don't have a good intuition of usability issues that may arise.</p>

<p>Are there applications that allow sorting by multiple columns using the column headers? Would you be able to point me to these? Are there any useful usability results regarding such interfaces -- which work better, which less so? </p>

<p>Also, while I am mostly interested in the specification of the interface, any hints to pass on to the people implementing it would be appreciated, e.g. publicly available libraries that provide parts of a solution (especially Java).</p>

<p>Edit: Two people have suggested using an Excel-style dialogue box. This is not going to work. For my application, users need to find the ""best match"" among existing table entries (which is often not a perfect match). The table is too big to keep in your head, so you need to keep scanning the relevant parts, and it's useful to repeatedly sort the table in order to get multiple views. Having to go through a dialogue box with multiple options for each change of view is just too slow; by the time you're done with the box, you've forgotten the results from the previous view.</p>

It is fed random bf programs to execute (as part of a genetic algorithm project). The problem I face is, the program turns out to have an infinite loop in a sizeable number of cases, and hence the GA gets stuck at the point.<br>
So, I need a mechanism to detect infinite loops and avoid executing that code in bf.<br>
One obvious (trivial) case is when I have</p>

<pre><code>[]
</code></pre>

<p>I can detect this and refuse to run that program.<br>
For the non-trivial cases, I figured out that the basic idea is: to determine how one iteration of the loop changes the current cell. If the change is negative, we're eventually going to reach 0, so it's a finite loop. Otherwise, if the change is non-negative, it's an infinite loop.<br>
Implementing this is easy for the case of a single loop, but with nested loops it becomes very complicated. For example, (in what follows (1) refers to contents of cell 1, etc. )</p>

<pre><code>++++ Put 4 in 1st cell (1)
&gt;+++ Put 3 in (2)
&lt;[   While( (1) is non zero)
    --   Decrease (1) by 2
    &gt;[   While( (2) is non zero)
        -    Decrement (2)
        &lt;+   Increment (1) 
    &gt;]   
    (2) would be 0 at this point
    +++  Increase (2) by 3 making (2) = 3
&lt;]   (1) was decreased by 2 and then increased by 3, so net effect is increment
</code></pre>

<p>and hence the code runs on and on. A naive check of the number of +'s and -'s done on cell 1, however, would say the number of -'s is more, so would not detect the infinite loop.<br>
Can anyone think of a good algorithm to detect infinite loops, given arbitrary nesting of arbitrary number of loops in bf?</p>

<p>EDIT: I do know that the halting problem is unsolvable in general, but I was not sure whether there did not exist special case exceptions. Like, maybe Matlab might function as a Super Turing machine able to determine the halting of the bf program. I might be horribly wrong, but if so, I would like to know exactly how and why. </p>

<p>SECOND EDIT: I have written what I purport to be infinite loop detector. It probably misses some edge cases (or less probably, somehow escapes Mr. Turing's clutches), but seems to work for me as of now. 
In pseudocode form, here it goes:</p>

<pre><code>subroutine bfexec(bfprogram)
begin
    Looping through the bfprogram,
        If(current character is '[')
            Find the corresponding ']'
            Store the code between the two brackets in, say, 'subprog'
            Save the value of the current cell in oldval
            Call bfexec recursively with subprog
            Save the value of the current cell in newval
            If(newval &gt;= oldval)
                Raise an 'infinite loop' error and exit
            EndIf
        /* Do other character's processings */

Originally each function made a call to <code>memcache_connect()</code>, however that was unnecessary, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>mc-&gt;insert()  
mc-&gt;get()  
mc-&gt;delete() 
</code></pre>

<p>would make three memcache connections. I worked around this by creating a construct for the class:</p>

<pre><code>function __construct() {
    $this-&gt;mem = memcache_connect( ... );
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then using <code>$this-&gt;mem</code> wherever the resource was needed, so each of the three functions use the same <code>memcache_connect</code> resource.</p>

<p>This is alright, however if I call the class inside other classes, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>class abc
{
    function __construct() {
        $this-&gt;mc = new cache_class;
    }
}    
class def
{
    function __construct() {
        $this-&gt;mc = new cache_class;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>then it is still making two <code>memcache_connect</code> calls, when it only <em>needs</em> one.</p>

<p>I can do this with globals but I would prefer not to use them if I don't have to.</p>

<p>Example globals implementation:</p>

<pre><code>$resource = memcache_connect( ... );

class cache_class
{
    function insert() {
        global $resource;
        memcache_set( $resource , ... );
    }
    function get() {
        global $resource;
        return memcache_get( $resource , ... );
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then no matter how many times the class is called there will only be one call to <code>memcache_connect</code>.</p>

<p>Is there a way to do this or should I just use globals?</p>

To this end, I'm looking for the equivalent of what I would have thought would be ControllerContext.Current but isn't.  Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit for clarification:</strong> I've got a generic form control which is JavaScript-based but I'd like to add an option so that it works with noscript.  At the moment my Controller sets the ViewData.Model to a JSON-ified Models.FormResponse&lt;T&gt;.</p>

<p>This FormReponse is set up with the status of the post and any error messages that were generated, so I'd like a GetActionResult() method which does the script/noscript check (a hidden form input) and either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sets the Model to the JSONed FormResponse and returns a View(), or</li>
<li>Serializes the FormResponse to the Session and returns a Redirect().</li>
</ol>

<p>As this obviously changes the return value and I don't want to do the check myself every time, I need to call View or Redirect from the FormResponse's GetActionResult method in order to call this as:</p>

<pre><code>return formResponse.GetActionResult();
</code></pre>

<p>I know with a more astronautical design this could be made even more robust but as the noscript option is not a major feature at the moment, I just need to get a quick solution working that doesn't break other things.</p>

<p>The following, implemented in an ActionResult class, does the job for me.  Thanks CVertex!</p>

<p>My project has a bunch of .cpp (Implementation) and .hpp (Definition) files.</p>

jump_to_folder app theappname build v1
jump_to_folder app theappname build 1

<p><code>jump_to_folder</code> is the scripts name, <code>app</code> is the command, <code>theappname</code> is a ""fixed-location"" parameter, ""build"" and ""v2"" etc are arguments (For example, possible arguments would be any number/any number prefixed with a v, or build/source/tmp/config)</p>

The PHP script then passes the info through to another domain (the newsletter mailer URL) via curl to sign up the user.</p>

<p>So far, so good, and it works on roughly 70% of the computers on which it's been tested (it's being tested live from the website, not locally). However, on some computers, it doesn't appear that the LoadVars.sendAndLoad call is being made, as the email addresses sent from those computers aren't showing up on the subscriber list. I know that the PHP script still works on those computers as I've made a barebones HTML form that acts in exactly the way the Flash app does (POSTs to same PHP script with same variables, etc) and it works on all computers.</p>

<p>Here's the relevant AS:</p>

<pre><code>submit_btn.onRelease = function(){
    submitOutAnimation();
    this.enabled = false;
    var sendvar_lv:LoadVars = new LoadVars();
    var loadvar_lv:LoadVars = new LoadVars();
    loadvar_lv.onLoad = function(success:Boolean){
        gotoAndStop(""successful"");
    }
    sendvar_lv.email = entryField_mc.myAdd.text;
    sendvar_lv.sendAndLoad(""http://notmyrealdomainname.com/passthrough.php?ck=""+new Date().getTime(),loadvar_lv,""POST"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Could this be a security problem with the Flash client settings? Do you have any other ideas?  I've been under the impression that there isn't much variation in Flash playback across different computers (other than performance) assuming they have the same flash player version, and this experience is shattering that illusion...</p>

<p>I've created a batch file called build.bat which executes the devenv build like this:</p>

<p>In vim I've pointed the :make command to that batch file:</p>

<p>I've tried a number of different errorformat settings that I've found on various sites around the net, but none of them have parsed out the errors correctly.  Here's a few I've tried:</p>

<pre><code>set errorformat=%*\\d&gt;%f(%l)\ :\ %t%[A-z]%#\ %m
set errorformat=\ %#%f(%l)\ :\ %#%t%[A-z]%#\ %m
set errorformat=%f(%l,%c):\ error\ %n:\ %f

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
It looks like using msbuild instead of devenv is probably the right way to go (as per Jay's comment).</p>

<p>Using msbuild the makeprg would be:</p>

<pre><code>:set makeprg=msbuild\ /nologo\ /v:q
</code></pre>

<p>Sample output whould be:</p>

<pre><code>Controller\FieldFactory.cs(14,19): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'IFieldNothing' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like the tricky part here may lie in the fact that the path is relative to the .csproj file, not the .sln file which is the current directory in Vim and lies one directory above the .csproj file.</p>

<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>
I figured it out...</p>

<pre><code>set errorformat=\ %#%f(%l\\\,%c):\ %m
</code></pre>

<p>This will capture the output for both devenv /Build and msbuild.
However, msbuild has one catch.  By default, it's output doesn't include full paths.  To fix this you have to add the following line to your csproj file's main PropertyGroup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;GenerateFullPaths&gt;True&lt;/GenerateFullPaths&gt;

<p>In my recent study of programming, I've found myself more and more wishing I was better at math. You all know the scenario when programming books start to generalize something in a math way (""Therefore, we may say that for all <code>&lt;some single letter&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;lots of letters&gt;</code>""). My eyes glaze over in such situations. I know that that is <strong>mostly</strong> due to me being stupid, but it seems that if I could just improve my higher math skills, maybe I could get more out of such things.</p>

Currently I have some controls, such as an <code>UISlider</code> and text box, in the <code>FlipsideView</code>. The <code>UISlider</code> already has a method which is being called when the value changes, using targets and selectors. However, I would also like to be able to read, from the <code>MainView</code>, the current (or last) value of the <code>UISlider</code> and <code>textbox</code>.</p>

<p>Keep in mind I am new to development on a Mac, and would appreciate any guidance as to where I should look up such information, be it through the use of delegates or perhaps I am missing something obvious in the structure of the template.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
I am taking a look at the structure and have some more details: The <code>UISlider</code> is being created in <code>FlipsideView.m</code>. I noticed that the Done button is created from <code>RootViewController.m</code> and probably I should move the <code>UISlider</code> code over there. I may incorrectly be using the <code>View</code> to keep code that would be more appropiate in a Controller.</p>

<p>I built the system originally to walk through the array and find the max the usual way, by comparing the value at the current position to a recorded max-so-far, and updating a position variable when the max-so-far changes.  This worked well, an O(n) algo that was very simple.  I later learned that I need to keep not only the top value, but the top three or four.  I extended the same procedure and complicated the max-so-far into an array of four max-so-fars and now the code is ugly.  </p>

<p>It still works and is still sufficiently fast because only a trivial amount of computations have been added to the procedure.  it still effectively walks across the array and checks each value once.</p>

<p>I do this in MATLAB with a sort function that returns two arrays, the sorted list and the accompanying original position list.  By looking at the first few values I have exactly what I need.  I am replicating this functionality into a C# .NET 2.0 program.  </p>

<p>I know that I could do something similar with a List object, and that the List object has a built in sort routine, but I do not believe that it can tell me the original positions, and those are really what I am after.  </p>

<p>It has been working well, but now I find myself wanting the fifth max value and see that rewriting the max-so-far checker that is currently an ugly mess of if statements would only compound the ugliness.  It would work fine and be no slower to add a fifth level, but I want to ask the SO community if there is a better way.  </p>

<p>Sorting the entire list takes many more computations than my current method, but I don't think it would be a problem, as the list is 'only' one or two thousand floats; so if there is a sort routine that can give back the original positions, that would be ideal.</p>

<p>As background, this array is the result of a Fourier Transform on a kilobyte of wave file, so the max values' positions correspond to the sample data's peak frequencies.  I had been content with the top four, but see a need to really gather the top five or six for more accurate sample classification.</p>

The resulting emails are very professional, they have built-in analytics, also integrate with Google Analytics, and it's awesome for a ton of other reasons.</p>

<p>If you're looking to do bulk emails with Rails, I would suggest using the <a href=""http://mailchimp.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mailchimp</a> service (here's my <a href=""http://mailchimp.com/?aid=43f492c80ae71fa07dfae4d64&amp;afl=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">affiliate link</a> that has a bonus on signup) along with the <a href=""http://github.com/bgetting/hominid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hominid gem</a>.  This will allow you to sync all your user emails from your database to Mailchimp, then use a real bulk service instead of some crappy patched together one.</p>

What I'd like to try and do is have the query form at the top of the page, the user press Submit and the results show up in a YUI DataTable below the query form.</p>

<p>Normally, of course, on a HTML form the user presses Submit, the request gets sent to the server, and I use Struts to process it and then forward the request to a JSP and HTML gets sent back to the browser. That's what I do on a daily basis. With Ajax, I understand it's different in that I should return XML instead. Not a problem. Easy to do.</p>

<p>The questions I have deal with the YUI side of things. When the Submit button is pressed, what happens? Not normal form submission, right? Do I implement an onSubmit() JavaScript function which then triggers some YUI DataSource to go fetch the data? How do the request params get passed? Hopefully I don't have to construct the request manually. I'm guessing that I use a YAHOO.util.XHRDataSource and that's the DataSource for the DataTable.</p>

<p>I've managed to get the YUI DataTable to work using an HTML table element. Now I just need to switch it over to real data. Curiously, the YUI documentation seems a bit weak here, unless I'm missing something. Maybe this is just basic Ajax that the YUI docs don't cover?</p>

<pre><code> &amp;gt; ${make.log}
</code></pre>

<p>part which equates to ""> log.txt"".  </p>

<p>This redirection seems to create a file called ""program"" on the C drive and messes up all sorts of services and windows generally doesnt like it.  To get around this Im manually deleting this file after the bat file has executed. </p>

<p>The problem is i now need to run a similar task for another project entirely and if they run at the same time then the first will lock the file called ""program"" and the second will fail.  Not exactly a great situation for Continuous integration.</p>

<p>I searched on the net but because the file is called program i get all sorts of rubbish results.  Anyone got any ideas on a work around.  I tried the output parameter on the exec task but the issue remains the same.</p>

<p>I wrote the framework of a MOS 6502 CPU emulator yesterday, the registers, stack, memory and all the opcodes are implemented. (Link to source below)</p>

<p>I can manually run a series of operations in the debugger I wrote, but I'd like to load a NES rom and just point the program counter at its instructions, I figured that this would be the fastest way to find flawed opcodes.</p>

<p>I wrote a quick NES rom loader and loaded the ROM banks into the CPU memory.</p>

<p>The problem is that I don't know how the opcodes are encoded. I know that the opcodes themselves follow a pattern of one byte per opcode that uniquely identifies the opcode, </p>

<pre><code>0 - BRK
1 - ORA (D,X)
2 - COP b
</code></pre>

<p>etc</p>

<p>However I'm not sure where I'm supposed to find the opcode argument. Is it the the byte directly following? In absolute memory, I suppose it might not be a byte but a short. </p>

<p>Is anyone familiar with this CPU's memory model?</p>

<p>EDIT: I realize that this is probably shot in the dark, but I was hoping there were some oldschool Apple and Commodore hackers lurking here.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks for your help everyone. After I implemented the proper changes to align each operation the CPU can load and run Mario Brothers. It doesn't do anything but loop waiting for Start, but its a good sign :)</p>

<p>my user model has many relations (details, addresses, roles...) who get loaded with eager loading. That creates really huge SQL queries, for some cases, it takes almost a minute to load 30 users. On the other hand removing the eager loading generates hundreds of queries, in the end I have the same problem: loading the page is slow.</p>

<p>I used to develop on Java &amp; Oracle, for this kind of big queries I used to create views, those views were then cached for a faster rendering. It was extremely boring to maintain, as I had to update the database fields manually in the views scripts etc...</p>

<p>BUT it really had fantastic performances.... so I was wondering if anyone ever tried to implement something to take benefits of Mysql views in active record ?</p>

<p>I just did some basic tests, here's my view (just a few fields for the example, I have a standard Restful Authentication user table, and a big table ""details"" for the personal datas ):</p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW users_vs AS SELECT
users.id              ,          
users.login           ,          
users.email           ,          
details.last_name           ,
details.first_name          ,
details.phone               ,
details.fax                 ,
FROM `users`   LEFT OUTER JOIN `details` ON details.user_id = users.id ;
</code></pre>

<p>Then a model:</p>

<pre><code>class UsersV &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end
</code></pre>

<p>Tried a few things in my console:</p>

<pre><code>u=UsersV.find(:first)  # ok !
u=UsersV.find_by_last_name('smith') #=&gt; ok !
us=UsersV.find_all_by_last_name('smith') #=&gt; ok too !
</code></pre>

<p>looking at the log, simple queries are just handled the same way as any table queries</p>

<p>Of course, those fake models would just be used to read datas.</p>

<p>I'm wondering:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if someone already tried that ?</p></li>
<li><p>if it's a good idea ?</p></li>
<li><p>if I should look into something like memcached instead...</p></li>

This would be very easy if we could use the IIS integrated security. However we can't do this. We don't have a trust to the domain controller of the customer. ANd we want to website to be available to the general internet. Only when people are connecting from within the clients network they should automatically login.</p>

<p>What we have is a list of domain accounts and a way to query the DC via LDAP in asp.net code. When anonymous access is allowed in IIS, IIS never challenges the browser for credentials. And thus our application never gets the users credentials.</p>

<p>Is there a way to force the browser into sending the credentials (and thus be able to use single sign-on) with IIS accepting anonymous request.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> </p>

<p>I tried sending 401: unauthorized, www-authenticate: NTLM headers by myself. What happens next (as Fiddler tells me) is that IIS takes complete control and handles the complete chain of request. As I understand from various sources is that IIS takes the username, sends a challenge back to the browser. The browser returns with encrypted reponse and IIS connects to the domain controller to authenticate the user with this response.</p>

<p>However in my scenario IIS is in a different windows domain than the clients and have no way to authenticate the users. For that reason building a seperate site with windows authenticaion enabaled isn't going to work either.</p>

<p>For now I have to options left which I'm researching:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creating a domain trust between our hosting domain and the clients domain (our IT department isn'tto happy with this)</li>
<li>Using a NTML proxy to forward the IIS authentication requests to the clients domain controller (we have a VPN connection available to connect via LDAP) </li>

<p>As you can see it is a simple animation that elongates a couple of divs. It works OK until I embed it on my main page. The problem seems to be that there is too much OTHER content that breaks the beauty of the smooth animation. I was thinking of me being lame in implementing the JavaScript, CSS etc. but after a couple of tests and reverse engineering I found out that THE MORE CONTENT (images, text, video) I HAVE ON THE PAGE, THE WORSE THE QUALITY OF THE ANIMATION IS. I can only guess what the reason is... I really like my animation :)! Appreciate the help! </p>

<p><a href=""http://nettuts.com/demos/test_poll/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This demo</a> shows how it should look like. I get it to work like this when the page has less content on it. By bad quality I mean not smooth flow of the bars. The worst case is when the bars appear in their final width in an instant.Tested it on Mozilla and Chrome and IE7 - no difference.</p>

I just asked a question about how the erlang compiler implements pattern matching, and I got some great responses, one of which is the compiled bytecode (obtained with a parameter passed to the c() directive):</p>

<pre><code>{function, match, 1, 2}.
  {label,1}.
    {func_info,{atom,match},{atom,match},1}.
  {label,2}.
    {test,is_tuple,{f,3},[{x,0}]}.
    {test,test_arity,{f,3},[{x,0},2]}.
    {get_tuple_element,{x,0},0,{x,1}}.
    {test,is_eq_exact,{f,3},[{x,1},{atom,a}]}.
    return.
  {label,3}.
    {badmatch,{x,0}}
</code></pre>

<p>its all just plain erlang tuples. I was expecting some cryptic binary thingy, guess not. so Im asking this on impulse here (I could look at the compiler source but asking questions always ends up better with extra insight), how is this output translated in the binary level?</p>

<p>say <code>{test,is_tuple,{f,3},[{x,0}]}</code> for example. Im assuming this is one instruction, called 'test'... anyway, so this output would essentially be the AST of the bytecode level language, from which the binary encoding is just a 1-1 translation?
This is all so exciting, I had no idea that I can this easily see what the erlang compiler break things into. </p>

<p>It compiles, though with this message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Advisory: Cannot tell what pointer points to, assuming global memory space</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and a reference to a line in some temporary cpp file. I can get this to work by commenting out some seemingly arbitrary code which makes no sense to me.</p>

<p>The kernel is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>__global__ void string_search(char** texts, int* lengths, char* symbol, int* matches, int symbolLength)

    int localMatches = 0;
    int blockId = blockIdx.x + blockIdx.y * gridDim.x;

    __shared__ int localMatchCounts[32];

    bool breaking = false;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; (lengths[blockId] - (symbolLength - 1)); i += blockThreads)
    {
        if(texts[blockId][i] == symbol[0])

                    break;
                }
            }
            if (breaking) continue;
            localMatches++;
        }
    }

    localMatchCounts[threadId] = localMatches;

    __syncthreads();

    if(threadId == 0)
    {
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; 32; i++)
        {
            sum += localMatchCounts[i];
        }
        matches[blockId] = sum;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I replace the line</p>

<pre><code>localMatchCounts[threadId] = localMatches;
</code></pre>

<p>after the first for loop with this line</p>

<pre><code>localMatchCounts[threadId] = 5;
</code></pre>

<p>it compiles with no notices. This can also be achieved by commenting out seemingly random parts of the loop above the line. I have also tried replacing the local memory array with a normal array to no effect. Can anyone tell me what the problem is?</p>

<p>The system is Vista 64bit, for what its worth.</p>

<p>Edit: I fixed the code so it actually works, though it still produces the compiler notice. It does not seem as though the warning is a problem, at least with regards to correctness (it might affect performance).</p>

<p>I would like to write unit tests to test the entire family of functions for this property, without having to write an individual test case for each function (particularly since more functions might be added later). </p>

<p>One way to do this would be to iterate over a list of these functions:</p>

<pre><code>import unittest
import numpy

from somewhere import the_functions
from somewhere.else import TheClass

class Test_the_functions(unittest.TestCase):
  def setUp(self):
    self.matrix1 = numpy.ones((5,10))
    self.matrix2 = numpy.identity(5)

  def testOutputShape(unittest.TestCase):
     """"""Output of functions be of a certain shape""""""
     for function in all_functions:
       output = function(self.matrix1, self.matrix2)
       fail_message = ""%s produces output of the wrong shape"" % str(function)
       self.assertEqual(self.matrix1.shape, output.shape, fail_message)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
  unittest.main()
</code></pre>

<p>I got the idea for this from <a href=""http://www.diveintopython.net/unit_testing/romantest.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dive Into Python</a>. There, it's not a list of functions being tested but a list of known input-output pairs. The problem with this approach is that if any element of the list fails the test, the later elements don't get tested.</p>

<p>I looked at subclassing unittest.TestCase and somehow providing the specific function to test as an argument, but as far as I can tell that prevents us from using unittest.main() because there would be no way to pass the argument to the testcase.</p>

<p>I also looked at dynamically attaching ""testSomething"" functions to the testcase, by using setattr with a lamdba, but the testcase did not recognize them.</p>

<p>How can I rewrite this so it remains trivial to expand the list of tests, while still ensuring every test is run?</p>

<p>My question is how does the compiler know that ppoly1 is a Rectangle and that ppoly2 is a Triangle, so that it can call the correct area() function? It could find that out by looking at the ""Polygon * ppoly1 = &rect;"" line and knowing that rect is a Rectangle, but that wouldn't work in all cases, would it? What if you did something like this?</p>

<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; ((Polygon *)0x12345678)-&gt;area() &lt;&lt; endl;

Not one response over there, which is pretty disappointing.  I also cannot figure out how to put a bounty on this question, but I would really, really love to get this issue solved.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have looked at many posts to see if this was posted before, and it was not.  Here's the short version:</p>

<p>I am going through the sample FB Connect tutorial (v1) and cannot make it work in IE8 on Win7.  It works as expected on FF3 on Win7.</p>

<p>Long Version:</p>

<p>I was suprised that things weren't working since I had pretty much copy and pasted over the content.  I skipped over the bit with the alert() javascript call, so I put that in to see if the parser was even getting to that.  I put the following code in:</p>

<pre><code>[my raw html]
Or use, &lt;fb:login-button length=""long"" onlogin=""alert('yo!!!');""&gt;&lt;/fb:login-button&gt;
[/my raw html]
</code></pre>

<p>The Alert is not popping on IE8.  It works on FF.</p>

<p>When I change back to calling the update_user_box(), my HTML looks like:</p>

<pre><code>Or use, &lt;fb:login-button length=""long"" onlogin=""update_user_box();""&gt;&lt;/fb:login-button&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    function update_user_box() {
        var user_box = document.getElementById(""user"");
        user_box.innerHTML =
            ""&lt;span&gt;""
            + ""&lt;fb:profile-pic uid='loggedinuser' facebook-logo='true'&gt;&lt;/fb:profile_pic&gt;""
            + ""Welcome, &lt;fb:name uid='loggedinuser' useyou='false'&gt;&lt;/fb:name&gt;.""
            + ""You are signed in.""
            + ""&lt;/span&gt;""

        FB.XFBML.Host.parseDomTree();
    }

    FB.init(""23e24c73feed7ca0f6afd876575842de"", ""../../Connect/xd_receiver.htm"", { ""ifUserConnected"": update_user_box });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this works in FF3 just fine.  My picture shows up and everything.  It actually makes me more upset that it worked in FF3 than a complete no work situation.</p>

<p>Here is the witnessed behavior in IE8:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When I click on the FBConnect button. the javascript window pops up and loads the right logon page</p></li>
<li><p>Focus changes back to the main window (the one with my app)</p></li>
<li><p>The main IE8 window (the one where I clicked the connect button) now shows a facebook logon page.</p></li>
<li><p>When I input my credentials into the FB javascript window, the page loads a blank doc

&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>5, If I close that window and type my credentials into the app window, the page reloads with the FBConnect button.</p>

<p>As I said, I am getting the expected behavior in FF3, but not IE8.  I even tried IE8's compatability mode, but that didn't work either.  Anyone have any clues as to what is happening?</p>

<p>My HTML tag looks like:</p>

<p>At various points in time, I need to clear out my array and refresh the data from my data source.  However, just calling <code>removeAllObjects</code> on my <code>NSMutableArray</code> object does not trigger the KVO updates, so the list on screen remains unchanged.</p>

<p><code>NSArrayController</code> has <strong>no</strong> <code>removeAllObjects</code> method available, which seems really weird. (It does have <code>addObject</code>, which I use to add the objects, ensuring the KVO is triggered and the UI is updated.)</p>

<p>The cleanest way I've managed to cause this happen correctly is:</p>

<pre><code>[self willChangeValueForKey:@""myArray""];
[myArray removeAllObjects];
[self didChangeValueForKey:@""myArray""];
</code></pre>

<p>...so I'm kind of having to do the KVO notification manually myself (this is in my test app class, that contains the <code>myArray</code> property, which is <code>NSMutableArray</code>, as mentioned.)</p>

<p>This seems wrong - is there a better way? From my googling it seems a few people are confused by the lack of <code>removeAllObjects</code> in <code>NSArrayController</code>, but haven't seen any better solutions.</p>

<p>I have seen this solution:</p>

<pre><code>[self removeObjectsAtArrangedObjectIndexes:
  [NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndexesInRange:
    NSMakeRange(0, [[self arrangedObjects] count])]];
</code></pre>

<p>but this looks even more unpleasant to me. At least my solution is at least marginally self-documenting.</p>

<p>Did Apple not notice that sometimes people might want to empty a list control being managed via an <code>NSArrayController</code> object?  This seems kind of obvious, so I think I must be missing something...</p>

<p>Aside: of course, if I add new items to the array (via <code>NSArrayController</code>), then this triggers a KVO update with the <code>NSArrayController/NSTableView</code>, but:</p>

On the other hand it can be a synchronization bottleneck if used from multiple threads, demands explicit deallocation and introduces possibility of memory leaks.

There are a handful of services that a few applications use. These services are mostly used internally, so a basic authentication and authorization scheme (such as Windows-based) is enough.</p>

<p>We want, however, expose some of the services to some business partners. The set of services they have access to depend on the contract. Kind of a standard architecture.</p>

<p>I think we can implement a <em>service gateway</em> which authenticates the requests and relays them to the correct internal service endpoint (this resembles simple ESB), so we can centralize the authentication/authorization code and expose one single endpoint to the world.

Agent granularity - how much state should one agent manage - implications on performance etc or are their good patterns for mapping shared state object graphs to agent based system. tips on mapping domain models to design.

If I use a joined JPA query it generates just one SQL query but doesn't find rows will null relationship.</p>

<p>Example, consider this simple schema. A person lives at an address and is employed by a company. Both address and employer are optional and can thus be null.</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public  class Person {
    public name;

    @ManyToOne
    @Column(nullable=true)
    public Address address

    @ManyToOne
    @Column(nullable=true)
    public Company employer
}

@Entity
public  class Address {
    address attributes ...
}

@Entity
public  class Company {
    company attributes ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Not shown above is that each JPA entity has some sort of ID (key):</p>

<pre><code>@Id
public Integer id;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I'm seeing is that a single JPA query on Person results in multiple SQL queries on the database. For example, the following JPA query:</p>

<pre><code>select p from Person p where ...
</code></pre>

<p>results in the SQL query:</p>

<pre><code>select ... from Person where ...
</code></pre>

<p>and also the following pair of SQL queries for <strong>each</strong> retrieved person:</p>

<pre><code>select ... from Address a where a.id=xxx
select ... from Company c where c.id=yyy
</code></pre>

<p>This has a huge impact on performance. If the query result set is 1000 people, then it generates 1+1000+1000=2001 SQL queries.</p>

<p>So I tried optimizing the JPA query by forcing it to join:</p>

<pre><code>select p from Person p join p.address a join p.employer e where ...
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>select p, a, e from Person p join p.address a join p.employer e where ...
</code></pre>

<p>This results in one single SQL query with a bunch of joins. The problem is if address or employer is null, then the joined query won't find it.</p>

<p>So I'm left with either using the join-less query which is slow, or the fast joined query that doesn't retrieve rows will null relationships. I must be missing something here. Surely there's a way for fast and complete querying.</p>

<p>Ok, the background:</p>

<p>I need to create a Huffman tree of codes from the information provided by the FFC4, DHT (Define Huffman Table) header in a jpg file. The DHT header defines the Huffman table in this way:</p>

<p>1) A series of 16 bytes. Each byte defines how many symbols have a Huffman code of n amount of bits where n is the position of the byte in the series. (did that make any sense?!!) For example the raw data in hex is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>00 01 05 01 01 01 ... 00</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this means that:</p>

<pre><code>Num of bits:    1   2   3   4   5   6   7 ...  16  
Num of codes:   00  01  05  01  01  01  01 ... 00
</code></pre>

<p>2) After the list of 16 bytes come the actual symbols themselves. For example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3) Combining the two parts we see that their are:<br>
 00 codes with 1 bit.<br>
 01 codes with 2 bits: so take the first symbol from the list: 00<br>
 05 codes with 3 bits: so take the next 5 symbols from the list: 01 02 03 04 05<br>
 .. and so on</p>

<p>4) Finally we have to work out the actual Huffman codes from the information above. If you're a mathematical genius, you may have spotted already that these codes can be worked out by simply incrementing a binary number with the appropriate number of bits for every new code at a certain bit length. When the bit length increases, simply increment the binary number and then double it and carry on. It becomes obvious to everyone else when you've drawn out a number of these binary trees by hand...</p>

<p>5) So this is the code I used to work out the Huffman codes and store them in an array: (first I read the data at 1) and put it in an array: dhtBitnum)</p>

<pre><code>            int binaryCode = 0;
            count = 0;
            StringBuffer codeString = new StringBuffer();               

            //populate array with code strings
            for (int numBits=1; numBits&lt;=16; numBits++) {

                //dhtBitnum contains the number of codes that have a certain number of bits
                for (int i=1; i&lt;=dhtBitnum[(numBits-1)]; i++) {

                    //turn the binary number into a string
                    codeString.append(Integer.toBinaryString(binaryCode)); 
                    //prepend 0s until the code string is the right length
                    for(int n=codeString.length(); n&lt;numBits; n++) {
                        codeString.insert(0, ""0"");
                    }
                    //put the created Huffman code in an array
                    dhtCodes[count]=codeString.toString();
                    binaryCode++;
                    count ++;
                    codeString.delete(0, codeString.length());
                }
                binaryCode = binaryCode &lt;&lt; 1;

            }
</code></pre>

<p>Once I have generated the Huffman codes and stored them in order, I can just add the symbols that they refer to in order as they come along in 2). This may not be terribly elegant but it seems to work at least and creates the correct tables.</p>

<p>6) If anyone is still following this, you deserve a medal.</p>

<p>7) Now the problem is I'd like to store this information in a binary tree so that I can efficiently decode the jpg image data later on, rather than searching through arrays everytime. Unfortunately I can't figure out a nice clean and efficient way to do this directly from the information provided in the jpg headers as above.<br>
The only way I can think of is by working out the Huffman codes as above first, then implementing some method that creates nodes as needed and saves the symbols in the appropriate place, using the codes as an address of sorts. However this seems such a round about way that is also duplicating the information I need, I'm sure there must be a much better and simpler method.</p>

<p>8) So if anyone understood my ramblings, I'd be very grateful for some suggestions. I realise this is a very specific problem, but if nothing else the info above might prove helpful to someone. I am still very new at this so excuse my ignorance, easy to understand code is especially welcome!</p>

<p>The same logic could be applied to, say, color-coding of block comments in programming code--anything inside the block comment is not treated the same way as the stuff outside the comments.

"417275","1","417302","","2009-01-06 16:47:04","","10","5755","<p>So I was playing around a little more with attributes in .NET, and realized that every call to Type.GetCustomAttributes() creates a new instance of my attribute. Why is that? I would think that the attribute instance would basically be a singleton-per-MemberInfo, with 1 instance bound to the Type, PropertyInfo, etc...</p>

<p>Here is my test code:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

namespace AttribTest
{
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class)]
class MyAttribAttribute : Attribute
{
    public string Value { get; set; }

    public MyAttribAttribute()
        : base()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Created MyAttrib instance"");
    }
}

[MyAttrib(Value = ""SetOnClass"")]
class MyClass
{
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Getting attributes for MyClass."");
        object[] a = typeof(MyClass).GetCustomAttributes(false);
        ((MyAttribAttribute)a[0]).Value = ""a1"";

        Console.WriteLine(""Getting attributes for MyClass."");
        a = typeof(MyClass).GetCustomAttributes(false);
        Console.WriteLine(((MyAttribAttribute)a[0]).Value);

        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now if <em>I</em> were to implement attributes, I would expect the output to be:</p>

<pre><code>Created MyAttrib instance
Getting attributes for MyClass.
Getting attributes for MyClass.
a1
</code></pre>

<p>Where the ""class loader"" (sorry, I have more of a Java background, not 100% sure how .net loads its types) would compile MyClass, and create an instance of MyAttribAttribute, and store them together somewhere. (probably the Perm Gen in the heap if this were Java) The 2 calls to GetCustomAttributes() would then just return the same earlier created instance.</p>

<p>But the actual output is:</p>

<pre><code>Getting attributes for MyClass.
Created MyAttrib instance
Getting attributes for MyClass.
Created MyAttrib instance
SetOnClass
</code></pre>

<p>So... why? It seems like creating a new instance of all these objects for every call is a bit excessive, and not good for performance/memory management.  Is there any way to always get the same instance over and over?</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas why it was designed this way?</p>

<p>The reason I care at all is because I made a custom attribute that internally holds some validation information, so in the Attribute I basically have a ""private bool Validated"" that I set to true. The validation stuff takes a while, so I don't want to run it every time. Now the problem is that since it creates a new instance of the attribute each time I get the attributes, Validated is always ""false"".</p>

Here's my problem - this code is shared between a web application and a non-web application, In the web application, I'm using System.Web.HttpContext to determine the user's preferred language, but now my Windows app won't even compile, because it says HttpContext isn't defined (I've already tried adding an imports for the full namespace - no dice).</p>

<p>I would love to use some kind of try/catch block if I can't otherwise work around it, but that doesn't change that the windows app won't compile with a reference to HttpContext in it.

"21328579","1","","","2014-01-24 06:18:20","","2","5761","<p>I am attempting to learn how to program a little. I am making this script for my Raspberry Pi, but the concept doesn't have to be specifically for it. I want to have a button press that will execute one of two commands:</p>

<p>If held for one second, then run command A
If held for five seconds, then run command B
It is okay for command A to run multiple times while waiting for B to register.</p>

<p>Here is my script, and afterwards I will explain its purpose:</p>

<pre><code>import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import uinput
inport time
import os

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.IN)

def main():
     events = (
          uinput.KEY_ESC,
          )

     device = uinput.Device(events)

     device.emit(uinput.KEY_ESC, 1) #Press
     device.emit(uinput.KEY_ESC, 0) #Release
</code></pre>

<p>Then, here are the two things that I want to have added:</p>

<pre><code>while 1:

     if time.sleep(1)
     if GPIO.input(17)==True:
          main()
          break

while 1:

     if time.sleep(10)
     if GPIO.input(17)==True:
          os.system(""sudo reboot"")
          break
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, this script will cause the button to have two purposes. Pressing it for one second will emulate a keystroke of the key ESC. Pressing it for ten seconds will cause it to reboot the system. How can I have the two happen at the same time? Learning Python is pretty challenging for me, but I've had no programming experience at all until now.</p>

<p><strong>The question (finally)</strong></p>

<p>So - I would like to know from you what you consider important/unimportant/supplementary etc. in a package manager for Emacs.</p>

<p><strong><em>Some ideas</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Many packages (the <a href=""http://www.emacsmirror.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Emacsmirror</a> provides that largest available collection of packages, but there is no explicit support in any package manager yet).</li>
<li>Only packages that have been tested.</li>
<li>Support for more than one package archive (so people can choose between many/tested packages).</li>
<li>Dependency calculated based on required features only.</li>
<li>Dependencies take particular versions into account.</li>
<li>Only use versions that have been released upstream.</li>
<li>Use versions from version control systems if available.</li>
<li>Packages are categorized.</li>
<li>Packages can be uninstalled and updated not only installed.</li>
<li>Support creating fork of upstream version of packages.</li>
<li>Support publishing these forks.</li>
<li>Support choosing a fork.</li>
<li>After installation packages are activated.</li>
<li>Generate autoload files.</li>
<li>Integration with Emacswiki (see wikirel.el).</li>
<li>Users can tag, comment etc. packages and share that information.</li>
<li>Only FSF-assigned/GPL/FOSS software or don't care about license.</li>
<li>Package manager should be integrated be distributed with Emacs.</li>
<li>Support for easily contacting author.</li>
<li>Lots of metadata.</li>
<li>Suggest alternatives before installing a particular package.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>I am hoping for these kinds of answers</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pointers to more implementations, discussions etc.</li>
<li>Lengthy descriptions of a set of features that make up your ideal package manager.</li>
<li>Descriptions of one particular desired/undesired feature. Feel free to elaborate on my ideas from above.</li>
<li>Surprise me.</li>

<p>I have the following content goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support a book I'm writing</li>
<li>Move my blog to my own site (from blogger.com)</li>
<li>Publish my articles (more persistent content than a blog)</li>
<li>Host a forum with light use</li>
<li>Embed slide sharing and screencasts</li>
</ul>

<p>I have the following technology goals for implementing my site:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn more Python and Django</li>
<li>Leverage a CMS solution such as Pinax or Django-CMS</li>
<li>Utilize a CSS framework, such as Blueprint or YUI</li>
<li>I develop on a Mac OS X platform</li>
<li>I'm comfortable developing in a CLI, but I'd like to practice Eclipse or NetBeans</li>
<li>I'd like to employ testing during development</li>
<li>Please, no Microsoft languages or tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Any suggestions for technology choices that support these goals?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  Apologies if the question above was too unclear or general.  What I'm asking for is if folks have had experience doing a similar modest website, what would be recommendations for tools, frameworks, or techniques outside of those I listed?</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there another Python CMS that I should consider besides the two I listed?  E.g. there may be a great Python solution, but it isn't built on top of Django.</li>
<li>Perhaps all current Python CMS packages are too ""alpha,"" and I'd be better off writing my own from scratch?  Although I am up to it, I'd rather leverage an existing package.</li>
<li>Given this kind of project, would you deploy a CMS with built-in (or plug-in) support for blogs, forums, etc. or would you rather design a simpler website and embed the more complex content management using other services, relying on your own website only as a dumb proxy or portal.  E.g. one can re-publish Blogger.com content using the Google Gdata API.  One can embed re-branded Nabble.com archives into any website, which may provide forum/mailinglist functionality more easily than running the forum itself.</li>
<li>Sometimes a CMS package has its own CSS integrated, and using another CSS framework would be redundant or otherwise make no sense.  Yes?  No?</li>
<li>Are there plugins for Django in Eclipse or Netbeans?  I understand there's a pretty nice environment for Rails development in NetBeans, and I've read some people wish longingly for something similar for Django, but I don't know if these wishes have since been realized.</li>
<li>What are some current preferred tools for unit and functional testing a Django application?  Are these integrated with Eclipse or Netbeans?</li>

"711101","1","711534","","2009-04-02 18:50:50","","1","5765","<p>I have an ASP.NET application that implements keep-alive by using a hidden IFRAME with a refresh header (or meta refresh tag in the page).</p>

<p>For many - but not all - instances of Internet Explorer (reproduced so far on IE7 and IE8 beta - but not for everyone!) if you move between two secure pages that both contain this keep-alive IFRAME, you get something like this sequence of events:</p>

<pre>
 0s: load page1.html - includes keepalive.html, schedules a refresh at 15s
 5s: click the page2 link
     load page2.html - includes keepalive.html, schedules a refresh at 20s
15s: refresh of frame on page1 happens; mixed content error box displayed
</pre>

<p>At this point the error ""This page contains both secure and non-secure content"" is displayed in the browser. </p>

<p><em>page1.html:</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Page 1&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is Page 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""page2.html""&gt;Go to Page 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=""keepalive.html"" width=""500"" height=""200"" /&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Page 2 is the same but says Page 2, and links to Page 1, instead.</p>

<p><em>keepalive.html:</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content=""15"" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This is the keep alive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In all the browsers I have tested this in I have ensured that the internet zone has permission to do a meta refresh and is set to prompt when displaying mixed content.  I have read all the pages suggesting that you need to have a src="""" tag on your IFRAME or IE will consider it insecure - by design it has to have a src tag, which is that of the keep-alive page.</p>

<p>If you sit on Page 1 forever, the IFRAME refreshes fine.  The error only shows up the first time after you change to Page 2.</p>

<p>I am looking for a way to fix this with minimal change: a better method for keep-alive would be to use a <a href=""http://www.adamtibi.net/post/2008/02/11/session-keep-alive-web-control.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">control &amp; automatically-refreshing images</a>, which I will investigate for future versions.  A possible workaround I have in mind is having contents of the IFRAME be a regular XMLHttpRequest to the server, instead of a meta refresh.  A simpler bugfix would be even better.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> I have marked Grant Wagner's answer as correct because it lead me to the actual problem: the Lenovo Password Manager add-on, CpwmIEBrowserHelper, causes this error.  This neatly explains why some people see this problem and not others - most of the people I asked have ThinkPads.  Disabling the extension makes the refresh problem go away.</p>

<p>As we can't cause everyone who might use the application to fix this problem, we are going to go with a javascript timer and refreshing the window location, updating the keepalive.html page to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=""pragma"" content=""no-cache""&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This is the keep alive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

  setTimeout ('ReloadPage()', 15000 );

  function ReloadPage() {
     window.location = window.location;
  }

All has been good so far, however, once in a while I run into the generic '<code>objc_exception_throw</code>' message at runtime.  When this happens, the source of this exception is very difficult to find.  After some trial and error I found my answer.  One of the parameters was misspelled.  </p>

<p>I tried to just make several regular war files, but Tomcat keeps (according to the servlet spec) these war files completely separate from each-other, so that they cannot share their classes, for example.</p>

<p>I need to plugins to be able to see the ""main"" classpath.</p>

<p>I need to main application to have some control over the plugins, such as being able to list them, and set their configuration.</p>

<p>I would like to maintain complete separation between the plugins themselves (unless they specify dependencies) and any other unrelated web applications that may be running on the same Tomcat.</p>

<p>I would like them to be rooted under the ""main"" application URL prefix, but that is not necessary.</p>

<p>I would like to use Tomcat (big architectural changes need to be coordinated with too many people), but also to hear about a clean solution in the EJB or OSGi world if there are. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Application.Core.Entities</p>
  
  <p>Application.Xtend.CustomerName.Entities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Core project I have an entity <strong>Customer</strong> defiend. In the XTend project, I have an entity defined that subclasses Customer named <strong>xCustomer</strong> (for lack of a better name at this time...). </p>

<p>The idea here is that we have a Core domain model in our application. A customer can then create a new assembly that contains extensions to our core model. When the extension assembly is present a smart <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">IRepository</a> class will return a subclass of the core class instead.</p>

<p>I am attempting to map this relationship in <a href=""http://nhforge.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">NHibernate</a>. Using <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Fluent NHibernate</a> I was able to generate this mapping:</p>

    &lt;component name=""Name"" insert=""true"" update=""true""&gt;
      &lt;property name=""LastName"" column=""LastName"" length=""255"" type=""String"" not-null=""true""&gt;
        &lt;column name=""LastName"" /&gt;
      &lt;/property&gt;
      &lt;property name=""FirstName"" column=""FirstName"" length=""255"" type=""String"" not-null=""true""&gt;

<p>But NHib throws the following error:</p>

<p>Which makes sense xCustomer is not defined in the Core library.</p>

<p>Is it possible to span different assemblies like this? Am I approaching the problem wrong?</p>

<p>This function doesn't work with IE, and I don't know why. I get no error-warnings with this javascript.
These are de Fade-in functions:</p>

    var opacEnd=0;

    var timer = 0;

    for(i = opacStart; i &gt;= opacEnd; i--) {

    } 

    var elemento = document.getElementById(id);
    if (opacEnd==0){
    elemento.style.display='none';

}


function opacity(id, opacStart, opacEnd, millisec) {

<p>Another problem that I have: The fadeout function doesn't work properly. The div fades, but the event ""click"" is fired when the div is hide. This is the function for fadeout:</p>

<pre><code>function fadeOutAndHide (id,millisec)

    var object = document.getElementById(id).style;
    var opacStart = 100;
    var opacEnd=0;

        timer++;

    } 

    var elemento = document.getElementById(id);
    if (i==1){

On the other hand, while ScktComp unit does use WSAAsyncSelect, it basically only asynchronizes a BSD-style multiplexed socket app. You get dumped in a single event callback, as if you had just returned from select() in a loop, and have to do all the state machine navigation yourself.</p>

<p>The .NET situation is considerably nicer, with Socket.BeginRead / Socket.EndRead, where the continuation is passed directly to Socket.BeginRead, and that's where you pick back up. A continuation coded as a closure obviously has all the context you need, and more.</p>

<p>We have a large number of xml configuration files that we want merged into one master version at build time. Smaller config files are easier to maintain and one large file loads faster so I imagined this to be a popular build transformation process that I would find lots of good examples of on the net. </p>

<p>I was able to find some good solutions to one part of the problem <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/217591/concatenating-xml-files-with-xslt"">here at StackOverflow</a> but they all rely upon knowing the names of the xml files that need merging up front. This seems like an unnecessary overhead to me. It should be possible to write a build script which can dynamically calculate which input xml files are needed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the only way I could find to achieve this was a bit of a hack. It works like this,</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a random ant task I stole of the internet to write a directory listing into an xml file.</li>
<li>Feed the xml file into an xslt transformation that can then load the other directory listing referenced xml files and concatenate them.</li>
<li>Delete the temporary xml file containing the directory listing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's the ant script</p>

<pre><code>&lt;taskdef name=""xml-dir-list""
  classname=""net.matthaynes.xml.dirlist.AntFileListing""
  classpath=""antlib/xml-dir-listing.0.1.jar;
    antlib/jakarta-regexp-1.5.jar;antlib/log4j-1.2.14.jar""/&gt;

&lt;macrodef name=""build-plugin-xml"" description=""todo""&gt;
    &lt;attribute name=""pluginName""/&gt;

    &lt;xml-dir-list depth=""0"" verbose=""false"" 
      srcDir=""${src.dir}/@{pluginName}/forms/"" includesRegEx=""\.xml$"" 
      destFile=""${src.dir}/@{pluginName}/forms/fileList.xml""/&gt;

    &lt;xslt in=""${src.dir}/forms/fileList.xml""
      out=""${src.dir}/@{pluginName}/@{pluginName}_extn.yuix
      style=""${src.dir}/@{pluginName}/forms/extn.yuix.xsl"" /&gt;

    &lt;delete file=""${src.dir}/@{pluginName}/forms/fileList.xml""/&gt;
&lt;/macrodef&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the stylesheet,</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=""1.0"" 
  xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform""&gt;
    &lt;xsl:output method=""xml"" version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" indent=""yes""/&gt;

    &lt;xsl:template match=""/""&gt;
        &lt;Forms applicationId=""YFSSYS00011""&gt;
            &lt;GlobalExtensions&gt;
                &lt;Tasks/&gt;
            &lt;/GlobalExtensions&gt; 
            &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=""directory/file""/&gt;
        &lt;/Forms&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

    &lt;xsl:template match=""file""&gt;
        &lt;xsl:copy-of select=""document(@name)/Forms/Form""/&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Has anyone found a simpler way to achieve this dynamic discovery of what files to merge in XSLT? It's not surprising that XSLT cannot read directories directly, but I was hoping to find a simpler way to pass in a list of file names than through another xml file.</p>

<h1>Implemented Solution</h1>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/501133/dynamically-concatenating-xml-files-with-ant-and-xslt/501534#501534"">Dimitre's solution</a> worked great once I'd made a few extra tweaks to the ant script,</p>

<pre><code>&lt;taskdef name=""saxon-xslt"" classname=""net.sf.saxon.ant.AntTransform""
  classpath=""antlib/saxon9.jar;antlib/saxon9-ant.jar""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>[...]</p>

<pre><code>&lt;macrodef name=""build-plugin-xml"" description=""todo""&gt;
    &lt;attribute name=""pluginName""/&gt;

    &lt;saxon-xslt 
      in=""build.xml""
      out=""${compca.src.dir}/temp/@{pluginName}/@{pluginName}_extn.yuix""
      style=""antscripts/extn.yuix.xsl""&gt;
    &lt;param name=""formsDir"" 
      expression=""${compca.src.dir}/@{pluginName}/forms/""/&gt;
    &lt;/saxon-xslt&gt;
&lt;/macrodef&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the xsl stylesheet (which I moved)</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;xsl:stylesheet version=""1.0"" 
      xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform""&gt;
      &lt;xsl:param name=""formsDir"" /&gt;
        &lt;xsl:output method=""xml"" version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" indent=""yes""/&gt;

        &lt;xsl:template match=""/""&gt;
            &lt;Forms applicationId=""YFSSYS00011""&gt;
                &lt;GlobalExtensions&gt;
                    &lt;Tasks/&gt;
                &lt;/GlobalExtensions&gt;
                &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=
                  ""collection(
                  concat('file:///',
                  $formsDir,
                  '?select=*.yuix;recurse=yes;on-error=ignore'
                  )
                  )/*
                ""/&gt;
            &lt;/Forms&gt;

        &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

        &lt;xsl:template match=""file""&gt;
            &lt;xsl:copy-of select=""/Forms/Form""/&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

Having played around with serialization a little (and looked at the output), I don't understand how loading the data back in could know when it's reached the end of the map for example, if I simply save out all the items one after another.

<h2>Deploy assembled artifacts to production box</h2>

<p>Here, we create the <code>.war</code> (or whatever) elsewhere, configure it for production (possibly creating numerous artifacts for numerous boxes) and place the resulting artifacts on the production servers.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: No dev tools on production boxes, can re-use artifacts from testing directly, staff doing deployment doesn't need knowledge of build process</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>: two processes for creating and deploying artifacts; potentially complex configuration of pre-built artifacts could make process hard to script/automate; have to version binary artifacts </li>
</ul>

<h2>Build the artifacts <strong>on</strong> the production box</h2>

<p>Here, the same process used day-to-day to build and deploy locally on developer boxes is used to deploy to production.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: One process to maintain; and it's heavily tested/validated by frequent use.  Potentially easier to customize configuration at artifact creation time rather than customize pre-built artifact afterword; no versioning of binary artifacts needed.</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>: Potentially complex development tools needed on all production boxes; deployment staff needs to understand build process; you <strong>aren't</strong> deploying what you tested</li>
</ul>

<p>I've mostly used the second process, admittedly out of necessity (no time/priority for another deployment process).  Personally I don't buy arguments like ""the production box has to be clean of all compilers, etc."", but I <strong>can</strong> see the logic in deploying what you've tested (as opposed to building another artifact).  </p>

<p>However, Java Enterprise applications are so sensitive to configuration, it feels like asking for trouble having two processes for configuring artifacts.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Here's a concrete example:</p>

<p>We use OSCache, and enable the disk cache.  The configuration file must be inside the .war file and it references a file path.  This path is different on every environment.  The build process detects the user's configured location and ensures that the properties file placed in the war is correct for his environment.   </p>

<p>If we were to use the build process for deployment, it would be a matter of creating the right configuration for the production environment (e.g. <code>production.build.properties</code>).</p>

<p>If we were to follow the ""deploy assembled artifacts to the production box"", we would need an additional process to extract the (incorrect) OSCache properties and replace it with one appropriate to the production environment.</p>

<p>This creates two processes to accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p>So, the questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this avoidable without ""compiling on production""?</li>
<li>If not, is this worth it?  It the value of ""no compiling on production"" greater than ""Don't Repeat Yourself""?</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on what I have read, this should ensure that the only users able to access the Admin directory will be users who have been Authenticated and assigned the Admin role.</p>

<p>User authentication, saving the authentication ticket, and other related issues all work fine. If I remove the  tags from the web.config file, everything works fine. The problem comes when I try to enforce that only users with the Admin role should be able to access the Admin directory.</p>

<p>Based on this <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/311495"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MS KB article</a> along with other webpages giving the same information, I have added the following code to my Global.asax file:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_AuthenticateRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e) {
    if (HttpContext.Current.User != null) {
        if (Request.IsAuthenticated == true) {    
            // Debug#1            
            FormsAuthenticationTicket ticket = FormsAuthentication.Decrypt(Context.Request.Cookies[FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName].Value);
            // In this case, ticket.UserData = ""Admin""                
            string[] roles = new string[1] { ticket.UserData }; 
            FormsIdentity id = new FormsIdentity(ticket);
            Context.User = new System.Security.Principal.GenericPrincipal(id, roles);
            // Debug#2
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I try to log in, I am unable to access the Admin folder (get redirected to login page). </p>

<p>Trying to debug the issue, if I step through a request, if I execute Context.User.IsInRole(""Admin"") at the line marked Debug#1 above, it returns a false. If I execute the same statement at line Debug#2, it equals true. So at least as far as Global.asax is concerned, the Role is being assigned properly.</p>

<p>After Global.asax, execution jumps right to the Login page (since the lack of role causes the page load in the admin folder to be rejected). However, when I execute the same statement on the first line of Page_Load of the login, it returns false. So somewhere after Application_AuthenticateRequest in Global.asax and the initial load of the WebForm in the restricted directory, the role information is being lost, causing authentication to fail (note: in Page_Load, the proper Authentication ticket is still assigned to Context.User.Id - only the role is being lost).</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong, and how can I get it to work properly?</p>

<hr>

<p>I created an ADO.NET Entity Data Model and added all the tables to it. The .edmx file shows the 1-to-many relationship in the designer. I manually populated the database with data that would make sure each product has a company. Whenever I try to access a product's company, however, it always returns null instead of an instance of a company.</p>

<p>For example, running the following code in C#, returns null:</p>

<pre><code>var _db = new MyDBEntities();
var product = (from p in _db.Product
               where p.ProductID == 3
               select p).First();
product.Company // == null
</code></pre>

<p>Are there any steps I'm missing to get this to work?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<hr>

<h2>Things I have tried:</h2>

<hr>

<p>Running the following SQL, returns the company record correctly.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Company.*
FROM Product
  LEFT JOIN Company ON (Product.CompanyID = Company.CompanyID)
WHERE Product.ProductID = 3
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The next thing I would do to debug this issue, would be to run the following code:</p>

<pre><code>var _db = new MyDBEntities();
var product = (from p in _db.Product
               where p.ProductID == 3
               select p).First();
var company = (from c in _db.Company
               where c.CompanyID == product.CompanyID
               select c).First();
</code></pre>

<p>However, that does not compile because the field Product.CompanyID is hidden by the ORM generator and I don't see an option in the designer to add it.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next best thing to run I guess is the following, and it did return a company:</p>

<pre><code>var _db = new MyDBEntities();
var company = (from c in _db.Company
               where c.CompanyID == 2
               select c).First();
</code></pre>

<p>Just to be clear, Product with ID 3 corresponds to Company with ID 2.</p>

<hr>

<p>I tried creating the exact same relationship using <em>LINQ to SQL Classes</em> and it works fine.</p>

<p>Of course instead of using the DB Entities class, I am using the Data Context class.</p>

<p>Now I know that most programming languages offer some kind of join method for this. I just wonder how these might be implemented.
When I took introductory courses, I often tried to go it alone, but never found a satisfactory algorithm. Everything seemed rather messy, the problem being that you can not just loop through the array, concatenating the strings, as you would add one too many commas (either before or after the last string).
I don’t want to check conditions in the loop. I don’t really want to add the first or the last string before/after the loop (I guess this is maybe the best way?).</p>

<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51217/how-would-you-organize-a-subversion-repository-for-in-house-software-projects"">how-would-you-organize-a-subversion-repository-for-in-house-software-projects</a> and
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/222827/how-do-you-organize-your-version-control-repository"">how-do-you-organize-your-version-control-repository</a></p>

<p>I have also looked at chapter 8 of <a href=""http://www.pragprog.com/titles/svn/pragmatic-version-control-using-subversion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pragmatic Version Control using Subversion</a>.</p>

<p>They all have good advice, but I'm having a hard time relating it to my needs.</p>

<p>Basically, I want to organize the code for our web server.  We have a $WEBROOT/htdocs and $WEBROOT/cgi-bin.  Under our htdocs dir we have $WEBROOT/htdocs/js and $WEBROOT/htdocs/css for java script and style sheets.</p>

<p>Our ""projects"" are not really projects, but small bits of code - maybe a Perl script, java script file, and a style sheet.  We have maybe a hundred or so of these small ""projects"" that are all pretty much independent of each other, but all live under the same $WEBROOT on the same webserver.</p>

<p>Our code is not in subversion yet, but I want it to be - I am just having trouble organizing it efficiently.  We can have multiple svn repositories if needed, but if each repository was only 3-10 elements, that seems like a waste to me.</p>

<p>What I thought could work is something like this:  If I write a script to count the running processes on the webserver (for the sake of an example).  Let's say I have a perl script, a js file, and a css file.  I could name the ""project"" webserver_processes, and check it into the repository as:</p>

<pre><code>/svnrepo/webserver_processes/trunk
</code></pre>

<p>Under trunk, I could have:</p>

<pre><code>htdocs/html/webserver_processes
htdocs/js/webserver_processes
htdocs/css/webserver_processes
cgi-bin/webserver_processes
</code></pre>

<p>I don't have any static html docs in this ""project"" but if i did, they would go in the ""html"" directory.</p>

<p>The benefit I see in this structure is that I can checkout one ""project"" at a time without really affecting anything else on the web server.  The disadvantage (and maybe it isn't really a disadvantage) is deploying.  I would have to deploy 1 project at a time from the repository.  I don't see how it would be possible to create a working copy with my structure of $WEBROOT/htdocs and $WEBROOT/cgi-bin using this method.</p>

<p><strong>Another option:</strong></p>

<p>I could create a svn repository like this:</p>

<pre><code>/svnrepo/webcode/trunk
</code></pre>

<p>Under trunk would be all of the code on my web server, in these two directories:</p>

<pre><code>htdocs
cgi-bin
</code></pre>

<p>The huge disadvantage would be, for a small code change to 1 element, I would have to checkout every piece of code in my web environment.  The benefit (somewhat) would be I could do an ""svn update"" on our web server to pick up any changes committed to the repository.</p>

<p>Maybe I am just making this more complex than it should be, but does anyone have any advice on how I could efficiently organize my code in subversion?</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm using this inside of a JIT that has very little information about the code it is executing to get an approximation of what is constant. Yes, I realize I could have a constant map of mutable data, like the vsyscall page used by Linux. I <em>can</em> safely fall back on an assumption that anything that isn't included in the initial parse is mutable and dangerous, but I'm not entirely happy with that option.</p>

<p>Right now what I do is I read <code>/proc/self/maps</code> and build a structure I can binary search through for a given address's protection. Any time I need to know something about a page that isn't in my structure I reread /proc/self/maps assuming it has been added in the meantime or I'd be about to segfault anyways.</p>

<p>IE really struggles though.  With a 5x5 table IE's delay on the start of a drag is noticeable.  On a 10x10 table with maybe 100 items the start of the drag hangs the browser. </p>

<p>I want to be able to support up to round 20x15 cells and maybe up to 500 items - is this just impossible? It doesn't seem like it should be.</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong? Is there a way to do this that doesn't slow the page in IE like this?</p>

I'm aiming to build a framework to allow for the integration of different traffic simulation models. This integration is based upon the sharing of link connectivities, link costs, and vehicles between simulations.</p>

<p>To make a distributed simulation, I plan to have a 'coordinator' (star topology). All participating simulations simply register with it, and talk only to the coordinator. The coordinator then coordinates the execution of various tasks between each simulation.</p>

<p>A quick example of a distribution problem, is when one simulation is 'in charge' of certain objects, like a road. And another is 'in charge' of other roads. However, these roads are interconnected (and hence, we need synchronisation between these simulations, and need to be able to exchange data / invoke methods remotely).</p>

<p>I've had a look at RMI and am thinking it may be suited for this task. (To abstract out having to create an over-wire signalling discipline).</p>

<p>Is this sane? The issue here, is that simulation participants need to centralize <em>some</em> of their data storage in the 'coordinator' to ensure explicit synchronisation between simulations. Furthermore, some simulations may require components or methods from other simulations. (Hence the idea of using RMI).</p>

<p>My basic approach is to have the 'coordinator' run a giant RMI registry. And every simulation simply looks up everything in the registry, ensuring that the correct objects are used at each step.</p>

<p>Anyone have any tips for heading down this path?</p>

<p>I have a Crystal Report which displays customers' fuel transactions.  There are occasions when a duplicate transaction will be imported erroneously.  If/when this error is discovered, the admin will reverse transaction, thus leaving the two original duplicates and a ""negative"" transaction for the reversal.  Example:</p>

<pre><code>Date;     Qty;     Value;     Reversal

1/14/08     5       20         N
1/14/08     5       20         N
1/14/08    -5      -20         Y
1/20/08     8       56         N
1/22/08     9       62         N
1/22/08     9       62         N
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally, the customer will only see SINGLE transactions (or a duplicate transaction which has not been reversed yet).  If the transaction has been reversed, we only want them to see the original unique record.  Example (based on data above):</p>

<pre><code>Date;     Qty;     Value;

1/14/08     5       20
1/20/08     8       56
1/22/08     9       62
1/22/08     9       62
</code></pre>

<p>I already have a <strong><em>query</em></strong> which will return the data in the way I just described, but I need to integrate it with a crystal report which requires joins to other tables.  Performance is TERRIBLE if I use the sql that I already have, so I'm trying to see if it would be possible to hide duplicate (reversed) transactions within Crystal's formulas instead of using a SQL command as a table joined to other tables.</p>

<p>I am currently able to recover from the XmlSchemaValidationException by using a ValidationEventHandler with XMLReader which throws a Exception that I handle in the XML Processing code. However for some cases XMLException is being triggered which leads to termination of the process. </p>

<p>The following snippets of the code illustrate the current structure I am using; it is messy and code improvement suggestions are also welcome.</p>

<pre><code>    // Setting up the XMLReader
    XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();
    settings.ConformanceLevel = ConformanceLevel.Auto;
    settings.IgnoreWhitespace = true;
    settings.CloseInput = true;
    settings.IgnoreComments = true;
    settings.ValidationType = ValidationType.Schema;
    settings.Schemas.Add(null, ""schema.xsd"");
    settings.ValidationEventHandler += new ValidationEventHandler(ValidationCallBack);
    XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(""Sample.xml"", settings);   
    // Processing XML
    while (reader.Read())
    if (reader.NodeType == XmlNodeType.Element)
       if (reader.Name.Equals(""A""))
         processA(reader.ReadSubtree());            
    reader.Close(); 
   // Process Node A
   private static void processA(XmlReader A){
    try{
       // Perform some book-keeping 
       // Process Node B by calling processB(A.ReadSubTree())               
    }   
    catch (InvalidOperationException ex){

    }
    catch (XmlException xmlEx){

    } 
    catch (ImportException impEx){

    }
    finally{ if (A != null) A.Close(); }            
  }
  // All the lower level process node functions propagate the exception to caller.
  private static void processB(XmlReader B){
   try{
     // Book-keeping and call processC
   }
   catch (Exception ex){
    throw ex;
    }
   finally{ if (B != null) B.Close();}    
  } 
  // Validation event handler
  private static void ValidationCallBack(object sender, ValidationEventArgs e){
    String msg =  ""Validation Error: "" + e.Message +"" at line "" + e.Exception.LineNumber+
        "" position number ""+e.Exception.LinePosition;
    throw new ImportException(msg);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>When a XMLSchemaValidationException is encountered the finally block will invoke close() and the original XMLReader is being positioned on the EndElement of the subtree and hence the finally block in processA will lead to processing of the next node A.</p>

<p>However when a XMlException is encountered invoking the close method is not positioning the original reader on the EndElement node of the subtree and an InvalidOperationException is being throw.</p>

<p>I tried to use methods like skip, ReadToXYZ() methods but these are invariably leading to XMLExcpetion of InvalidOperationException when invoked on any node that triggered an exception.</p>

<p>The following is a excerpt from MSDN regarding the ReadSubTree method.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the new XmlReader has been
  closed, the original XmlReader will be
  positioned on the EndElement node of
  the sub-tree. Thus, if you called the
  ReadSubtree method on the start tag of
  the book element, after the sub-tree
  has been read and the new XmlReader
  has been closed, the original
  XmlReader is positioned on the end tag
  of the book element.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: I cannot use .Net 3.5 for this, however .Net 3.5 suggestions are welcome. </p>

<p>[Additional Info]</p>

<p>The reffererURL will always be on the end of the string so it could be possible to delete all of the query string after this point?</p>

string[] tRSplit = Regex.Split(test, ""&amp;referrerUrl"");
Response.Write(tRSplit[0]);

<p>and...</p>

<pre><code>System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;string&gt; testb = new System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;string&gt;(Convert.ToString(Request.QueryString).Split('&amp;'));
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; testb.Count; i++)

<p>I am aware that Guid provides a ToByteArray() method, but I would like to have that called when Guid is converted to byte[].

<p>I was experimenting with TypeConverter, but doesn't seem to work either:</p>

<p>In this case I cannot use window messages because I am trying to signal a windows service. I could use the pipe, but there will be many of these applications, and I would like to find a ""low cost"" solution if possible.</p>

<p>Other options like Memory mapped files have even more overhead than the pipe?</p>

<p>How would you do this?</p>

<p>How would I go about convincing Expander to collapse properly again?  Or modifying Resizer to not make Expander sad would work as well.</p>

<p>Expander documentation says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""For an Expander to work correctly, do not specify a Height on the Expander control when the ExpandDirection property is set to Down or Up. Similarly, do not specify a Width on the Expander control when the ExpandDirection property is set to Left or Right. When you set a size on the Expander control in the direction that the expanded content is displayed, the area that is defined by the size parameter is displayed with a border around it. This area displays even when the window is collapsed. To set the size of the expanded window, set size dimensions on the content of the Expander control or the ScrollViewer that encloses the content.""</p>

<p>The best idea I could come up with is to fork each update, so if it dies, the overall update just continues.
From what I gathered, it seems PHP threading isn't something to rely on, especially on a windows platform (which I unfortunately have to work on).</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/98174/9304"">Mike's answer</a> looks like the best-practices answer, although what I'll do is probably more like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/98126/9304"">Dan's answer</a> because the third-party hosting provider controls the load balancer and I don't want to deal with that mess.

<pre><code>play = (isMode) ? new MainMode(numberRanges, numberOfGuesses) : 
                  new TestMode(numberRanges, numberOfGuesses, randNo());
</code></pre>

<p>My Game (play) would either create a MainMode object or a TestMode object depending on a boolean value (isMode). As you can see I am adding an extra value into my TestMode object (randNo()). This value is used within TestMode to allow the user to input their own ""Random Number"", whereas within the MainMode constructor this was randomly generated. In this program both MainMode and TestMode are sub-classes of the abstract class Game.</p>

<p>Now I want to replace this line with a Factory Pattern, although I am unsure as my TestMode constructor requires an extra object and I am unsure where I would need to pass this value. If I were going to create a Factory it'd need to be in a new class, probably named GameFactory or ModeFactory or something along those lines.</p>

<p>How would I go about this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The problem here is that the code above is in my GUI, where the values for numberRanges, numberOfGuesses and the randNo() method are. I want to create a Factory class but I am unable to pass these values through because randNo() activates itself. Here is my randNo() method.</p>

<pre><code>private int randNo() {
    boolean isValidNumber = true;
    int testRandomNum = 0;
    while(isValidNumber) {
        try {
            testRandomNum = Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog(""Enter Random Number""));
            isValidNumber = false;
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, ""Sorry, but the number you entered was invalid"");
        }
    }

    return testRandomNum;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that whenever I pass randNo() it displays the JOptionPane. As I've said already the GUI and Logic is separate. The GUI is in a GUI package whilst the rest of the code is in the logic package.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Test]
(
    column1 int NOT NULL, 
    column2 int NOT NULL
);

insert into Test (column1, column2) values (2,3)
insert into Test (column1, column2) values (6,3)
insert into Test (column1, column2) values (4,6)
insert into Test (column1, column2) values (9,1)
insert into Test (column1, column2) values (5,8)
</code></pre>

<p>In the absence of the GREATEST function in SQL Server, I can get the larger of the two columns with this:</p>

<pre><code>select column1, column2, (select max(c) 
                            from (select column1 as c
                                   union all
                                  select column2) as cs) Greatest
  from test

<p>And I was hoping that I could simply sum them thus:</p>

<pre><code>select sum((select max(c)

<p>UPDATE: Eran, thanks - I used this approach. My final expression is a little more complicated, however, and I'm wondering about performance in this case:</p>

<pre><code>SUM(CASE WHEN ABS(column1 * column2) &gt; ABS(column3 * column4)
         THEN column5 * ABS(column1 * column2) * column6

<p>It is not possible to simply add (or subtract) a value, as the dates do not have a regular gap between them. </p>

<p>One possible application would be 'previous/next' links in a photo album or blog web application, where the underlying data is in a SQL table.</p>

<p>I think there are two possible cases:</p>

<p><strong>Firstly</strong> where each date is unique:</p>

<p>Sample data:</p>

<pre><code>1,3,8,19,67,45
</code></pre>

<p>What query (or queries) would give 3 and 19 when supplied 8 as the parameter? (or the rows 3,8,19). Note that there are not always three rows to be returned - at the ends of the sequence one would be missing.</p>

<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, if there is a separate unique key to order the elements by, what is the query to return the set 'surrounding' a date? The order expected is by date then key.</p>

<p>Sample data:</p>

<pre><code>(key:date) 1:1,2:3,3:8,4:8,5:19,10:19,11:67,15:45,16:8
</code></pre>

<p>What query for '8' returns the set:</p>

<pre><code>2:3,3:8,4:8,16:8,5:19
</code></pre>

<p>or what query generates the table:</p>

<pre><code>key date prev-key next-key
1   1    null     2
2   3    1        3
3   8    2        4
4   8    3        16
5   19   16       10
10  19   5        11
11  67   10       15
15  45   11       null
16  8    4        5

SomeObject obj2 = new SomeObject();
container2.SomeObject = obj2; // BAD because the previous value of SomeObject not disposed.

<p>There doesn't seem to be a good way to edit longer text columns in the SQL Server Managers for SQL Server 2000 or 2005.  While SQL Server Manager is really not for editing data in your db, what other tool does Microsoft provide that would normally allow you to do this?  Every other field is pretty easy to edit, except long text fields.  In Access, you could hit shift-f2 and it would pop up a nice dialog to edit your text in.</p>

<p>I'm interested in this because I'm writing up a paper on an algorithm that would benefit from any previous work on similar hashes.  In particular, it would be great if there is anything known about the collision properties of a hash algorithm like this.</p>

<p>The algorithm I'm interested in would hash integer vectors, but something for float vectors would also be cool.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong></p>

<p>The hash is intended for use in a hash table for fast key/value lookups.  There is no security concern here.</p>

<p>The desired answer is something like a set of constants that provably work particularly well for a hash like this - analogous to a multiplier and modulo which works better than others as a pseudorandom number generator.</p>

<p>For example, some choices of constants for a linear congruential pseudorandom generator are known to give optimal cycle lengths and have easy-to-compute modulos.  Maybe someone has done research to show that a certain set of multiplicative constants, along with a modulo constant, in a vector hash can reduce the chance of collisions amongst nearby integer vectors.</p>

</code></pre>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM oracleServer..owner.table1 WHERE id = @id;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I have is that the table on the lined server or Oracle is very big with 4M rows of data. The above query took about 2minutes to get data back. This code is just a simplied piece. Actually my SP has some other queries to update, insert data from the lined server to my SQL server. The SP took hours or 10+ hours to run with large Oracle db. Therefore T-SQL with lined server is not good for me.</p>

<p>Recently I found OPENQUERY and EXEC (...) AT linedServer. OPENQUERY() is very fast. It took about 0 time to get the same result. However, it does not support variable query or expressions. The query has to be a literal constant string.</p>

<p>EXEC() is in the same way to pass-through query to Oracle. It is fast as well. For example:</p>

<pre><code>EXEC ('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM owner.table1 WHERE id = ' + CAST(@id AS VARCHAR))
  AT oracleServer

<p>The problem I have is how to pass the result COUNT(*) back. I tried to google examples in web and msdn. All I can find are SQL or ExpressSQL linedServer examples like:</p>

<pre><code>EXEC ('SELECT ? = COUNT(*) FROM ...', @myCount OUTPUT) AT expressSQL
</code></pre>

<p>This query does not work for Oracle. It seems in Oracle, you can set value as output in this way:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) INTO myCount ...

<p><hr>
Updated: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/688361/70157"">Solved, bignose came through with the solution</a>.</p>

<p>using the :digraphs functionality of Vim. with a character encoding of Unicode, </p>

<p>see ':help digraphs' for documentation</p>

<p>I'm Still looking for a monospace Unicode font so it renders completely but with extra spaces it works great.</p>

<p>In order to see math characters UTF-8 has to be the encoding and a font that will display those characters.</p>

<p>I added the following to my vim configuration files.</p>

<p>created custom file: mathdoc.vim in syntax/</p>

<pre><code>"" set the encoding to be utf-8, requires gVim or a terminal capable of
"" unicode see ':help Unicode' for details
set encoding=utf-8
"" requires a font that has characters for the higher uniocode symbols
set guifont=MS\ Gothic
</code></pre>

<p>I added this to filetype to set this for my own custom extension .txtmt</p>

<pre><code>au BufNewFile,BufRead *.txtmt   setf mathdoc
</code></pre>

<p>but you could alternately call this with the file open:</p>

<pre><code>:set ft=mathdoc
</code></pre>

<p>digraphs works great as bignose specified below here is how it works</p>

<p>in insert mode:
press control+k followed by:</p>

<p>&there4; is S*</p>

<p>&ne; is !=</p>

<p>&sum; is +Z</p>

<p>&equiv; is =3</p>

<p>&lArr; is &lt;=</p>

<p>&rArr; is =></p>

<p>&hArr; is ==</p>

<p>&forall; is FA</p>

<p>&exist; is TE</p>

<p>&ni; is -)</p>

<p>see :digraphs for the complete list
* note if you only see half a screens worth you're character encoding is not unicode, unicode characters cover several screens, type :set encoding=utf-8 to switch to utf-8.</p>

<p>The table in the above link has the numbers for the characters that you'll need to find the keyboard shortcuts, 8756 is &there4; for example</p>

<p>There is a version 1.2, already tested and get the same issue. The post looks something like this.</p>

<pre><code>Host: foo.appspot.com
User-Agent: lwp-request/1.38
Content-Type: text/plain

   &lt;BLAH&gt;Hello World&lt;/BLAH&gt;
&lt;/XML&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have modified the example so the 202 isn't right, don't worry about that. On to the problem. The Content-Length matches the number of bytes on the file, however unless I manually increase the Content-Length it does not send all of the file, a few bytes get truncated. The number of bytes truncated is not the same for files of different sizes. I used the -r option on the script and I can see what it is sending and it is sending all of the file, but Google Appengine self.request.body shows that not everything is received. I think the solution is to get the right number for Content-Length and apparently it isn't as simple as number of bytes on the file or the perl script is mangling it somehow.</p>

<p>Update:
Thanks to Erickson for the right answer. I used printf to append characters to the end of the file and it always truncated exactly the number of lines in the file. I suppose I could figure out what is being added by iterating through every character on the server side but not worth it. This wasn't even answered over on the google groups set up for app engine!</p>

<p>I've run into two annoyances with the second type of automatic formatting, the &lt;% %> content formatting.</p>

<p>First is how new lines are added to statement blocks:</p>

<p>If I type this:</p>

<p>While the correction is right if this was a .cs file, for the tag soup that is .aspx files I find the first far more readable. Is there a way to turn off this behavoir without affecting the formatting of .cs files?</p>

<p>Second, whenever I write something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%=Html.ActionLink(""Report"",""ListItems"") %&gt;

<p>In code you normally need a ; or } to signal that you are done a line/section of code so that Visual Studio can format it. Is there a way to give this signal for a &lt;%= type of expression?</p>

<p>The <strong>view partial</strong> where the dropdown-menu should be implemented. Below the dropdown menu is a list of projects that should change according to the choice made in the dropdown menu:</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;!-- placeholder for AJAX dropdown menu --&gt;

   &lt;!-- list of projects related to categories chosen by the select tag --&gt;
   &lt;ul class=""projects""&gt;
     &lt;% @projects.each do |_project| %&gt;

<p>The <strong>Categories controller</strong> with the show-action that should be called:</p>

<pre><code>class CategoriesController &lt; ApplicationController
  def show
    # params[:id] should be the choice the user made in the dropdown menu
    @category = Category.find(params[:id])
    @projects = @category.projects.find(:all)

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html # show.html.erb
      format.js   # needed for ajax response?

  def index

    @category = @project.categories.first

<p>This does that: the code within all() asks if all the names in the list ('expvar') of columns in 'samples' are also names in 'grids'.

<p>The gTLD servers say the name server is ns1.service-provider-here.net and when we lookup the name at that server, it gives an authoritative answer but leaks a different NS name in the authority section (ns1.different-trade-name.net).</p>

<p>There are thousands of domains configured in this way. It doesn't seem to cause any problems, but it seems so wrong.</p>

<p>Does this actually matter? Is there ever going to be a situation where resolvers/clients will do an extra lookup or even fail to resolve the name because of this?</p>

We would like to make it possible to import custom initial settings as part of the installation.  The use case for this is if a company has 100 machines they want to install the software on, and they should all have a reference to the intranet web service in question, this should not need to be set up manually on all the machines.</p>

<p>We are currently using a VS2008 setup project to generate the install package.</p>

<p>Our idea so far has been to enable the installer to make a custom initial .config file with the information (from a template), and then put that in place instead of the default one that the setup project installs.</p>

<p>However, I can't see a way to do this other than these few:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hardcode the executable name into a custom installer action (deriving from System.Configuration.Install.Installer), in order to use the ConfigurationManager class to determine the .config file path.  This would require manual changes to the installer if the executable name changes.</li>
<li>Roll our own configuration classes or file/folder hierarchy to store the settings.  This would basically bar us from the advantages of the isolation mechanism (which is also the obstacle here) that .NET provides, if I understand correctly.</li>

The application is already established, so I'd rather an answer that didn't require me to rework the application's architecture.</p>

<p>My second question (maybe this should be a separate question):
Is there a better way to add fields to a db table than to copy it down, modify, and stick it up again? Please forgive if that's a dumb question - I'm new to ASP - new to Windows too.</p>

<p>I only have FTP access to the remote server.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

"563253","1","","","2009-02-18 23:04:30","","5","5851","<p>I have an interface, and two classes that implements the interface.  The classes have generic types.  I would like to clone from an instance of one class to the other.</p>

<pre><code>interface IFoo
{
    // stuff
}

class Foo&lt;T&gt; : IFoo
{
    // foo stuff
    // ifoo implementation
}

class Bar&lt;T&gt; : IFoo
{
    // bar stuff
    // ifoo implementation
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a Foo and would like a Bar.  Bar has a copy constructor taking a parameter of IFoo.
I created an extension method to implement the clone:</p>

<pre><code>public static Bar&lt;T&gt; Clone&lt;T&gt;(this IFoo foo) 
{
    return new Bar&lt;T&gt;(foo);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Calling the method requires the type:</p>

<pre><code>someFoo.Clone&lt;T&gt; ...
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to omit declaring the type when calling the method by modifying the extension method, or any other way, to allow the the instance to just be passed in without caring about its underlying type?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
Here is how this is being used to better illustrate the situation.</p>

<p>In a method I iterate a collection and return an enumeration of IFoo.  In the method I look at an attribute of the source collection and determine the type of the Foo.</p>

<pre><code>IFoo foo = null;

string type = element.Attribute(""Type"").Value;
switch (type)
{
    case ""int"":
        foo = new Foo&lt;int&gt;();
        break;

    case ""string"":
        foo = new Foo&lt;string&gt;();
        break;

    // etc
}
// other stuff

yield return foo;
</code></pre>

<p>The calling method has a List.  Later I select individual items from this list for use, at which point I would like a Bar instead of a Foo.  When selecting from the list the instances are of type IFoo, as in they only see the extension methods for ""this IFoo foo"".  I do not want to cast the IFoo to a Foo, that would require re-declaring the type of T.  I would just like to have Foo tell Bar what it is.  Is this possible?</p>

  <p>The big catch with toExponential, toFixed, and toPrecision is that they are fairly modern constructs not supported in Mozilla until Firefox version 1.5 (although IE supported the methods since version 5.5).

<p>I want to accomplish a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have events done in the browser (eg, drag and drop) trigger an AJAX notification that can raise a control event, which causes code on the page using the control to do whatever it needs to do (eg, change a value in a database). </li>
<li>Have partial updates (NOT using an updatepanel) that can do things like populate an auto-complete dropdown underneath a textbox. </li>
<li>Implement a single user control that is generic enough to be reused on several pages</li>
<li>Avoid having to implement logic on the page itself that passes events back to the control, because that is repetitive and hard to maintain </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm using jQuery for most of the client side stuff, but for the actual AJAX calls I don't really care if it's jQuery or the ASP AJAX libraries. </p>

<p>Effectively what would be perfect is PageMethods on the user control, that would be easily callable from client-side script. Unfortunately, as far as I'm aware, pagemethods do not work on user controls.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'll use an autocomplete control as an example: </p>

<p>I should be able to put the autocomplete control on the page, and then in the page code, have eg:</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub HandleLookup(ByVal input As String, ByRef list As List(Of String) Handles MyControl.LookupEntries
  list = New List(Of String)
  ' Query database for list of items.. 
  For Each item as String in FullItemList
    If item.StartsWith(input) then list.Add(item)
  Next
  Return list
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>And do nothing else .. the rest of the code should be in the usercontrol. </p>

<hr>

<p>Note, the controls I'm trying to make are much more specific than eg, autocomplete. They do not exist in any 3rd party libraries and I really need to be able to make them myself.</p>

my problem is when i start the http server with app.run() it blocks my

also tried to start it with thread.start_new_thread but it still
blocks.
is there an easy way to run web.py´s integrated http server in the

The .bat file calls up another .exe and the .bat file has a CMD DOS window that outputs critical error info to that DOS box from the .exe. If the .exe does not start correctly, I am able to check the results in our SQL DB. I need to close the current .bat file and re-launch it.
This seems fairly simple, I can get the ProcessID using the WMI call. I can terminate the process with a Terminate() command. This works for any .exe I use for testing: notepad, calc, iexplorer, etc. When I run the VBScript to kill the .bat file, it says it terminates the PID (which it does, since I cannot see the PID anymore), however, the DOS box is still open and the .exe called from the .bat file is still running. If I click on the ""X"" on the DOS box or right-click on the title bar and select ""Close"", the DOS box and the .exe are both killed. How do I get this script to work correctly. The server is running Windows Server 2003 (some are x32 and others are x64). Any ideas? Here is a version of my code, there have been several revs:</p>

<pre><code>If colFiles.Count = 0 Then
Wscript.Echo ""The file does not exist on the remote computer.""
Else
Wscript.Echo ""The file exists on the remote computer.""

<p>I have even tried to use the SendKeys to send ALt-F4, X, C, etc. AppActivate does bring the correct DOS box to the front.</p>

Yes, I am going to have to kill the process that this .bat file calls. Only down side is this DOS box stays open. Annoying but I can live with it. In the end I wrote a script similar to my first one but only checks for the instance I want to kill by checking the CommandLine parameter: (The first bit of code with ""-FAIL.txt"" test to see if a FAIL file is present, if it is, then the rest of the scipts executes)</p>

Specifically, I have a list of objects, each indexed by a key (possibly multiple per key). This implies a multimap. The problem with this, however, is that it means a possibly worse-than-linear lookup to find the location of an object. I'd rather avoid duplication of data, so having each object maintain it's own coordinate and have to move itself in the map would be bad (not to mention that moving your own object may indirectly call your destructor whilst in a member function!). I would rather some container that maintains an index both by object pointer and coordinate, and that the objects themselves guarantee stable references/pointers. Then each object could store an iterator to the index (including the coordinate), sufficiently abstracted, and know where it is. Boost.MultiIndex seems like the best idea, but it's very scary and I don't wany my actual objects to need to be const.</p>

<p>What would you recommend?</p>

<p>EDIT: Boost Bimap seems nice, but does it provide stable indexing? That is, if I change the coordinate, references to other elements must remain valid. The reason I want to use pointers for indexing is because objects have otherwise no intrinsic ordering, and a pointer can remain constant while the object changes (allowing its use in a Boost MultiIndex, which, IIRC, does provide stable indexing).</p>

<p>Our problem now is that we would like to add some additional features such as locking down parameters depending on user authority/groups in our transactional system.

    MWE testClass = new MWE();
    testClass.throwMalFormedURLException();
    System.out.println(""End of test"");

<p>But the Junit is reporting failure, even though the console is telling me I've got a MalformedURLException.</p>

<p>From the info I gathered so far, when sending the http request I need to add a header field with a key of ""Range"" and the value ""bytes=startoff-endoff"". Then the server returns a http response with the data between those offsets.</p>

<p>So roughly what I have in mind is to split the file to the number of allowed connections per file and send a http request per splitted part with the appropriate ""Range"". So if I have a 4mb file and 4 allowed connections, I'd split the file to 4 and have 4 http requests going, each with the appropriate ""Range"" field. Implementing the resume feature would involve remembering which offsets are already downloaded and simply not request those.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this the right way to do this?</li>
<li>What if the web server doesn't support resuming? (my guess is it will ignore the ""Range"" and just send the entire file)</li>
<li>When sending the http requests, should I specify in the range the entire splitted size? Or maybe ask smaller pieces, say 1024k per request?</li>
<li>When reading the data, should I write it immediately to the file or do some kind of buffering? I guess it could be wasteful to write small chunks.</li>
<li>Should I use a memory mapped file? If I remember correctly, it's recommended for frequent reads rather than writes (I could be wrong). Is it memory wise? What if I have several downloads simultaneously?  </li>
<li>If I'm not using a memory mapped file, should I open the file per allowed connection? Or when needing to write to the file simply seek? (if I did use a memory mapped file this would be really easy, since I could simply have several pointers).</li>
</ul>

There are some instances where I <strong>need</strong> to set ID values through code but I don't want to just hard code the IDs since I've done that before and it lead to DB alignment nightmares when the auto-incrementing IDs were changed when the DB was dumped to a new system.</p>

<p>What I want to do is create an enumerated constants that store the IDs as so that at the worst, only 1 file has to be updated if the DB is ever changed instead of trying to go through thousands upon thousands of lines of code to replace any ID in the system.</p>

<p>This will work on a single system, but in my company's service oriented environment, enumerations don't serialize with their values, just their names.</p>

<p>What is the best way to share IDs across a web service? I'd like to use either enumerations (the ideal situation) or constants in some way, but I can't seem to get this to work. I could make a web method that returns the IDs, but sending a web request for every ID and then serializing the response and deserializing on the client machine just sounds like a bad idea.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong><br>
I wasn't entirely clear about what I was asking, so I'll elaborate.</p>

<p>I want to have a group of constants. The enum would only be used because it groups constants together appropriately. I'm mainly interested in see if there is a way to share constants across a web service. I need the values the enum represent, not the enum itself. The enum is never sent between the service and the client except as an integer. Internally everything is stored as an ID, not an enum.</p>

<p>Having a separate shared library doesn't sound like the ideal solution since I'm almost at the completion point for this project and I'd only be storing 1 enum/class in the library. It seems like a bit of a waste to make for just one class.</p>

<li><p>The user is able to ""favorite"" an item in the database, which stores it in SQLite on their local device.</p></li>
<li><p>The user can also submit new items to the remote server that don't already exist, making them available for other users to favorite.</p></li>
<li><p>The user can search both databases, via a single search interface to find items.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm trying to decide the data structure for this, and how to deal with the resulting objects from the database.  I think I have two options for the objects:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The remote DB and the local DB have the same object type, and the local DB stores the id of the remote item to link the two</p></li>
<li><p>Separate objects for the remote item and the local item</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any ideas, thoughts, etc are greatly appreciated!</p>

"118955","1","118972","","2008-09-23 03:30:57","","7","5882","<p>For various reasons, we are writing a new business objects/data storage library. One of the requirements of this layer is to separate the logic of the business rules, and the actual data storage layer. </p>

<p>It is possible to have multiple data storage layers that implement access to the same object - for example, a main ""database"" data storage source that implements most objects, and another ""ldap"" source that implements a User object. In this scenario, User can optionally come from an LDAP source, perhaps with slightly different functionality (eg, not possible to save/update the User object), but otherwise it is used by the application the same way. Another data storage type might be a web service, or an external database.</p>

<p>There are two main ways we are looking at implementing this, and me and a co-worker disagree on a fundamental level which is correct. I'd like some advice on which one is the best to use. I'll try to keep my descriptions of each as neutral as possible, as I'm looking for some objective view points here. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Business objects are base classes, and data storage objects inherit business objects. Client code deals with data storage objects.</p>

<p>In this case, common business rules are inherited by each data storage object, and it is the data storage objects that are directly used by the client code. </p>

<p>This has the implication that client code determines which data storage method to use for a given object, because it has to explicitly declare an instance to that type of object. Client code needs to explicitly know connection information for each data storage type it is using.</p>

<p>If a data storage layer implements different functionality for a given object, client code explicitly knows about it at compile time because the object looks different. If the data storage method is changed, client code has to be updated.</p></li>
<li><p>Business objects encapsulate data storage objects.</p>

<p>In this case, business objects are directly used by client application. Client application passes along base connection information to business layer. Decision about which data storage method a given object uses is made by business object code. Connection information would be a chunk of data taken from a config file (client app does not really know/care about details of it), which may be a single connection string for a database, or several pieces connection strings for various data storage types. Additional data storage connection types could also be read from another spot - eg, a configuration table in a database that specifies URLs to various web services. </p>

<p>The benefit here is that if a new data storage method is added to an existing object, a configuration setting can be set at runtime to determine which method to use, and it is completely transparent to the client applications. Client apps do not need to be modified if data storage method for a given object changes. </p></li>
<li><p>Business objects are base classes, data source objects inherit from business objects. Client code deals primarily with base classes.</p>

<p>This is similar to the first method, but client code declares variables of the base business object types, and Load()/Create()/etc static methods on the business objects return the appropriate data source-typed objects. </p>

<p>The architecture of this solution is similar to the first method, but the main difference is the decision about which data storage object to use for a given business object is made by the business layer, not the client code. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know there are already existing ORM libraries that provide some of this functionality, but please discount those for now (there is the possibility that a data storage layer is implemented with one of these ORM libraries) - also note I'm deliberately not telling you what language is being used here, other than that it is strongly typed.</p>

<p>I'm looking for some general advice here on which method is better to use (or feel free to suggest something else), and why. </p>

Now I want to add another application B, which should keep track of the database changes of application A. Application B should do some calculations, when data has changed. There is no direct communication between both applications. Both can only see the database.</p>

<p>The basic problem is: Some data changes in the database. How can I trigger some C# code doing some work upon these changes?</p>

<hr>

<p>To give some stimulus for answers, I mention some approaches, which I am currently considering:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make application B polling for
changes in the tables of interest.
Advantage: Simple approach.
Disadvantage: Lots of traffic,
especially when many tables are
involved.</li>
<li>Introduce triggers, which will fire
on certain events. When they fire
they should write some entry into an
“event table”. Application B only
needs to poll that “event table”.
Advantage: Less traffic.
Disadvantage: Logic is placed into
the database in the form of triggers.
(It’s not a question of the
“evilness” of triggers. It’s a design
question, which makes it a
disadvantage.)</li>
<li>Get rid of the polling approach and
use SqlDependency class to get
notified for changes. Advantage:
(Maybe?) Less traffic than polling
approach. Disadvantage: Not database
independent. (I am aware of
OracleDependency in ODP.NET, but what
about the other databases?)</li>
</ol>

<p>What approach is more favorable? Maybe I have missed some major (dis)advantage in the mentioned approaches? Maybe there are some other approaches I haven’t think of?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit 1: Database independency is a factor for the ... let's call them ... ""sales people"". I can use SqlDependency or OracleDependency. For DB2 or other databases I can fall back to the polling approach. It's just a question of cost and benefit, which I want to at least to think about so I can discuss it.</p>

I am currently using the IFrame implementation of Thickbox.  The problem is that the URL to show is hardcoded into the ""alt' attribute of the button.

<p>Ideally, I would like to put the textbox value into the Search.aspx url but I can't seem to figure out how to do that.  My current alternative is to use jQuery to set the click function of the Search button to call a web service that will set some values in the ASP.NET session.  The Search.aspx page will then use the session variables to do the search.  However, this is a bit flaky since it seems like there will always be the possibility that the search executes before the session variables are set.</p>

<p>Is it best to declare these as protected, or private?</p>

<p>I can see arguments both ways - making them private is a far more conservative approach, but it can be argued that they could be made protected later if I want the method to be extended and it makes it clear which methods are extended by base classes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, is using private somehow antisocial, in that it impedes a theoretical future developer from extending my code without modification?</p>

<p>I don't know too much about sockets other than that basics, so bear with me.  The goal is for a client to look for a server on a local network, and this is the result of some cut/paste/edit code.  </p>

<p>This is the client code:</p>

<pre><code>IPEndPoint ipep = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(""127.0.0.1""), 10294);

    byte[] data = new byte[1024];
    public Form1()
    {

    }

    private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {

        Socket client = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp);
        client.SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel.IP, SocketOptionName.MulticastTimeToLive, 10);

        data = new byte[1024];
        int recv = client.ReceiveFrom(data, ref tmpRemote);
        this.IP.Text = ((IPEndPoint)tmpRemote).Address.ToString(); //set textbox
        this.Port.Text = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(data, 0, recv); //set textbox
        client.Close();
    }

                SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp);
        newsock.Bind(ipep);
        newsock.SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel.IP, SocketOptionName.AddMembership, new MulticastOption(IPAddress.Any,IPAddress.Parse(""127.0.0.1"")));

        while (true)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Waiting for a client..."");

            string welcome = ""7010"";
            data = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(welcome);
            newsock.SendTo(data, data.Length, SocketFlags.None, tmpRemote);
        }

<p>Here's why I want to do this...</p>

<p>On a payment page I have a <code>DropDownList</code> that allows my user to select their card type. Beneath that is a <code>TextBox</code> in which they type their card number.</p>

<p>I want to use a <code>RegularExpressionValidator</code> to validate that their card number is valid for their given card type. The card payment processing is performed manually in a different system, so I cannot rely on this to catch incorrect card details.</p>

<p>Therefore I need to use a different <code>ValidationExpression</code> for each card type. I would like to set the <code>ValidationExpression</code> using JavaScript, firing off the <code>DropDownList</code> onchange event.</p>

<p>My <code>DropDownList</code> is bound to an XML document:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:DropDownList ID=""ddlCardType"" runat=""server""
    DataTextField=""Text"" DataValueField=""Value""
    DataSourceID=""xdsCardTypes"" AppendDataBoundItems=""True""&gt;
    &lt;asp:ListItem Text=""(select)"" Value=""""&gt;&lt;/asp:ListItem&gt;
&lt;/asp:DropDownList&gt;
&lt;asp:XmlDataSource ID=""xdsCardTypes"" runat=""server""
    DataFile=""~/App_Data/PaymentCards.xml""&gt;
&lt;/asp:XmlDataSource&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the XML doc:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" ?&gt;
&lt;PaymentCards&gt;
  &lt;PaymentCard Text=""American Express"" Value=""AmericanExpress"" RegEx=""3[47](\d{13})""  /&gt;
  &lt;PaymentCard Text=""MasterCard"" Value=""MasterCard"" RegEx=""5[1-5](\d{14})"" /&gt;
  &lt;PaymentCard Text=""Maestro"" Value=""Maestro"" RegEx=""(5018|5020|5038|6304|6759|6761)\d{8,15}"" /&gt;
  &lt;PaymentCard Text=""Visa"" Value=""Visa"" RegEx=""4(\d{15}|\d{12})"" /&gt;
&lt;/PaymentCards&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In code-behind I'm creating a JavaScript function call and adding it to the onchange event of the <code>DropDownList</code>:</p>

<pre><code>XDocument paymentCards = XDocument.Parse(xdsCardTypes.GetXmlDocument().InnerXml, LoadOptions.None);

List&lt;string&gt; regExes = paymentCards.Descendants(""PaymentCard"")
    .Select(pc =&gt; pc.GetAttribute(""RegEx"").Value).ToList();

string setRegExValidatorScript = string.Format(""setRegExValidator('{0}', '{1}', {2});"",
    ddlCardType.ClientID,
    txtCardNumber_RegularExpressionValidator.ClientID,
    regExes.ToJavaScriptArgumentList());

ddlCardType.AddAttribute(""onchange"", setRegExValidatorScript);
</code></pre>

<p>And in a referenced .js file I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>function setRegExValidator(ddlCardTypeID, regExValidatorID, regExes)
{
    var regEx = regExes[$get(ddlCardTypeID).selectedIndex];

    var val = $get(regExValidatorID);

    // TODO: Set the ValidationExpression!
}
</code></pre>

<p>So my one missing link is the ability to set the <code>ValidationExpression</code> from JavaScript. Yes I could use a postback to achieve this, but that seems unnecessary.</p>

"272665","1","","","2008-11-07 16:44:20","","2","5891","<p>First of all, some background.</p>

<p>We have an order processing system, where staff enter billing data about orders in an app that stores it in a sql server 2000 database.  This database isn't the real billing system: it's just a holding location so that the records can be run into a mainframe system via a nightly batch process. </p>

<p>This batch process is a canned third party package provided by an outside vendor.  Part of what it's supposed to do is provide a report for any records that were rejected.  The reject report is worked manually.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it turns out the third party software doesn't catch all the errors.  We have separate processes that pull back the data from the mainframe into another table in the database and load the rejected charges into yet another table.  </p>

<p>An audit process then runs to make sure everything that was originally entered by the staff can be accounted for somewhere.  This audit takes the form of an sql query we run, and it looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM [StaffEntry] s with (nolock)
LEFT JOIN [MainFrame] m with (nolock)
    ON m.ItemNumber = s.ItemNumber 
        AND m.Customer=s.Customer 
        AND m.CustomerPO = s.CustomerPO -- purchase order
        AND m.CustPORev = s.CustPORev  -- PO revision number
LEFT JOIN [Rejected] r with (nolock) ON r.OrderID = s.OrderID
WHERE s.EntryDate BETWEEN @StartDate AND @EndDate
    AND r.OrderID IS NULL AND m.MainFrameOrderID IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>That's heavily modified, of course, but I believe the important parts are represented.  The problem is that this query is starting to take too long to run, and I'm trying to figure out how to speed it up.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure the problem is the JOIN from the <code>StaffEntry</code> table to the <code>MainFrame</code> table.  Since both hold data for every order since the beginning of time (2003 in this system), they tend to be a little large.  The <code>OrderID</code> and <code>EntryDate</code> values used in the <code>StaffEntry</code> table are not preserved when imported to the mainframe, which is why that join is a little more complicated.  And finally, since I'm looking for records in the <code>MainFrame</code> table that don't exist, after doing the JOIN we have that ugly <code>IS NULL</code> in the where clause.</p>

<p>The <code>StaffEntry</code> table is indexed by EntryDate (clustered) and separately on Customer/PO/rev.  <code>MainFrame</code> is indexed by customer and the mainframe charge number (clustered, this is needed for other systems) and separately by customer/PO/Rev.  <code>Rejected</code> is not indexed at all, but it's small and testing shows it's not the problem.  </p>

<p>So, I'm wondering if there is another (hopefully faster) way I can express that relationship?</p>

<p>For instance: Navigation menus. Lots of tutorials on how to make a static one, but what about dynamic? If I want to make a navigation bar that's different across pages, how would I go about doing that?</p>

<p>I guess my question really results to using MVC. The basic idea is really basic, and I understand that. But it seems that most applications have each part completely separate from each other... what if I want to, say, combine data from two models to display on the same page? To take the example I posed, if I have a NavModel and a PageModel, can my PageController access both models? I guess I'd assumed that a PageController can only access a PageModel, and none other. All examples I've seen seem to operate this way...is that a faulty assumption?</p>

<p>The logic is written as a <a href=""http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/3136"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pipelined table function</a>, following the pattern from the linked article. The table function uses a <code>PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION</code> declaration to permit the temporary table manipulation, and also accepts a cursor input parameter to restrict the denormalization to certain ID values.</p>

<p>I then created a view to query the table function, passing in all possible ID values as a cursor (other uses of the function will be more restrictive).</p>

<p>My question: is this all really necessary? Have I completely missed a much more simple way of accomplishing the same thing?</p>

<p>Every time I touch PL/SQL I get the impression that I'm typing way too much.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'll add a sketch of the table I'm dealing with to give everyone an idea of the denormalization that I'm talking about. The table stores a history of employee jobs, each with an activation row, and (possibly) a termination row. It's possible for an employee to have multiple simultaneous jobs, as well as the same job over and over again in non-contiguous date ranges. For example:</p>

<pre><code>| EMP_ID | JOB_ID | STATUS | EFF_DATE    | other columns...
|      1 |     10 | A      | 10-JAN-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | A      | 13-JAN-2008 |
|      1 |     12 | A      | 20-JAN-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | T      | 01-FEB-2008 |
|      1 |     10 | T      | 02-FEB-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | A      | 20-FEB-2008 |
</code></pre>

<p>Querying that to figure out who is working when in what job is non-trivial. So, my denormalization function populates the temporary table with just the date ranges for each job, for any <code>EMP_ID</code>s passed in though the cursor. Passing in <code>EMP_ID</code>s 1 and 2 would produce the following:</p>

<pre><code>| EMP_ID | JOB_ID | START_DATE  | END_DATE    |
|      1 |     10 | 10-JAN-2008 | 02-FEB-2008 |
|      2 |     11 | 13-JAN-2008 | 01-FEB-2008 |
|      1 |     12 | 20-JAN-2008 |             |
|      2 |     11 | 20-FEB-2008 |             |
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>END_DATE</code> allows <code>NULL</code>s for jobs that don't have a predetermined termination date.)</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this denormalized form is much, much easier to query, but creating it--so far as I can tell--requires a temporary table to store the intermediate results (e.g., job records for which the activation row has been found, but not the termination...yet). Using the pipelined table function to populate the temporary table and then return its rows is the only way I've figured out how to do it.</p>

<p>As the data-type for current read position and size I used size_t since that seems to be the most natural choice. I get around the warnings and it ought to work in 64-bit as well. </p>

<p>Right now, it takes close to 13 seconds to load this DataSet.  I can cut this to 700 milliseconds if I don't read the DataSet's schema and just let ReadXml infer the schema, but then the resulting DataSet doesn't contain any constraints.</p>

<p>I've tried doing this:</p>

<pre><code>Console.WriteLine(""Reading dataset with external schema."");
ds.ReadXmlSchema(xsdPath);
Console.WriteLine(""Reading the schema took {0} milliseconds."", sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);
foreach (DataTable dt in ds.Tables)
{
   dt.BeginLoadData();
}
ds.ReadXml(xmlPath);
Console.WriteLine(""ReadXml completed after {0} milliseconds."", sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);
foreach (DataTable dt in ds.Tables)
{
   dt.EndLoadData();
}
Console.WriteLine(""Process complete at {0} milliseconds."", sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);
</code></pre>

<p>When I do this, reading the schema takes 27ms, and reading the DataSet takes 12000+ milliseconds.  And that's the time reported <em>before</em> I call EndLoadData on all the DataTables.</p>

<p>This is not an enormous amount of data - it's about 1.5mb, there are no nested relations, and all of the tables contain two or three columns of 6-30 characters.  The only thing I can figure that's different if I read the schema up front is that the schema includes all of the unique constraints.  But BeginLoadData is supposed to turn constraints off (as well as change notification, etc.).  So that shouldn't apply here.  (And yes, I've tried just setting EnforceConstraints to false.)</p>

<p>I've read many reports of people improving the load time of DataSets by reading the schema first instead of having the object infer the schema.  In my case, inferring the schema makes for a process that's about 20 times faster than having the schema provided explicitly.</p>

<p>This is making me a little crazy.  This DataSet's schema is generated off of metainformation, and I'm tempted to write a method that creates it programatically and just deseralizes it with an XmlReader.  But I'd much prefer not to.</p>

<p>What am I missing?  What else can I do to improve the speed here?</p>

When a text object is suppressed the output for that field is an empty space.

<p>How can I best adjust the ant build process so that the version information in the svn checkout remains in the created build?</p>

<p>I was thinking along the lines of:</p>

<li>added svn:properties to all sources with keywords in places the compiler leaves them be</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I ended up using the svnversion approach (the accepted anwser), because it scans the entire subtree as opposed to svn info which just looks at the current file / directory. For this I defined the SVN task in the ant file to make it more portable. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;taskdef name=""svn"" classname=""org.tigris.subversion.svnant.SvnTask""&gt;
  &lt;classpath&gt;
    &lt;pathelement location=""${dir.lib}/ant/svnant.jar""/&gt;

    &lt;pathelement location=""${dir.lib}/ant/svnjavahl.jar""/&gt;
  &lt;/classpath&gt;        
&lt;/taskdef&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Not all builds result in webservices. The ear file before deployment must remain the same name because of updating in the application server. Making the file executable is still an option, but until then I just include a version information file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name=""version""&gt;
  &lt;svn&gt;&lt;wcVersion path=""${dir.source}""/&gt;&lt;/svn&gt;

<p>Thanks to John Saunders' reply, i'm a bit closer.
The HttpWebResponse.ContentEncoding property seems to always come in empty. However, HttpWebResponse.CharacterSet seems useful, and with this code, i'm getting closer:</p>

Dim respEncoding As Encoding = Encoding.GetEncoding(resp.CharacterSet)
Dim stIn As IO.StreamReader = New IO.StreamReader(resp.GetResponseStream(), respEncoding)

<p>Now Google.cn comes in perfectly, with all the chinese characters.<br>
However, Gap.Com is still coming in wrong.</p>

<p>For Gap.com, HttpWebResponse.CharacterSet is ISO-8859-1, the Encoding i'm getting through GetEncoding is {System.Text.Latin1Encoding}, which says ""ISO-8859-1"" in it's body name, AND the Content-Type META tag in the HTML specified ""charset=ISO-8859-1"".</p>

<p>My new app is going to reside in the same virtual directory, replacing the old one, but it has no longer oldpage.aspx, instead it has different layout, but it still needs the parameter from the old url.</p>

<li>The search bots, etc., are not a concern, this is internal application with dynamic content, which expires very often.</li>

<p>It seems to me that explicitly specifying serialVersionUID for new classes is bad. Consider the two cases of not changing it when layout has it should have been changed and changing it when it should not have. </p>

<p>Not changing when it should have been changed occurs almost only when it is explicit. In this case, it results in some very subtle, hard-to-find bugs. Especially during development, when class layout changes often. But if it has not been explicitly specified, it will change and the deserialization will break loudly, mostly likely solved by purging the repository.</p>

<p>Changing it when should not have would occur almost only when it is implicit. This is the rare case where class layout has changed but we still want to deserialize from the old serialized blobs. This will likely be caught during QA (<em>Strange errors after upgrade from 5.2 to 5.2.1, see attached stack trace</em>) and can be trivially fixed by setting a explicit value. </p>

<ul>
<li>enforce a read-only attribute on the returned collection ? (no <code>add()</code> or <code>remove()</code> possible)</li>
<li>enforce an immutable aspect to the returned collection ? (even the references of that collection can not be modified)</li>

So what I really want is Dynamic Prepared Statements, which is troublesome to make because bind_param and bind_result accept ""fixed"" number of arguments.  So I made use of an eval() statement to get around this problem.  But I get the feeling this is a bad idea.  Here's example code of what I mean</p>

<pre><code>// array of WHERE conditions
$param = array('customer_id'=&gt;1, 'qty'=&gt;'2');
$stmt = $mysqli-&gt;stmt_init();

$types = ''; $bindParam = array(); $where = ''; $count = 0;

// build the dynamic sql and param bind conditions
foreach($param as $key=&gt;$val)
{
    $types .= 'i';
    $bindParam[] = '$p'.$count.'=$param[""'.$key.'""]'; 
    $where .= ""$key = ? AND "";
    $count++;
}

// prepare the query -- SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE customer_id = ? AND qty = ?
$sql = ""SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE "".substr($where, 0, strlen($where)-4);
$stmt-&gt;prepare($sql);

// assemble the bind_param command
$command = '$stmt-&gt;bind_param($types, '.implode(', ', $bindParam).');';

// evaluate the command -- $stmt-&gt;bind_param($types,$p0=$param[""customer_id""],$p1=$param[""qty""]);

<pre><code> h1 { /* lots of style attributes */ }
 h2 { /* lots of style attributes */ }
 h3 { /* lots of style attributes */ }

<p>I am also creating some components where I have something like this, thats to say I need a header specific to that particular type of control.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The problem I'm encountering is that the <code>h1</code> under <code>titledimage</code> is also an <code>h1</code> as defined earlier so it inherits all the styles defined by <code>h1</code>. This is generally undesired - I just want <code>red</code> and <code>1px solid blue</code> for the header in the <code>.titledImage</code> div.</p>

<p>I was reading and trying to answer <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/503925/is-it-alright-to-use-multiple-h1-tags-on-the-same-page-but-style-them-differentl"">this question about H1 styles</a>. My conclusion is that if you are doing specific header styles (.titledimage h1) you cant really do generic header styles (h1) unless :</p>

<pre><code> a) you reset every style attribute in the '.titledimage h1' style
 b) you just use a class name instead of h1
 c) your `h1` style is defined with very few attributes that you'd 
    be overriding anyway

<p>I've noticed that for styling the <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YUI menu control</a> they actually use <code>H6</code> and I'm wondering if they are doing that to avoid such conflicts.</p>

<p>Should I </p>

<pre><code>a) be using &lt;h6&gt; like yahoo does?
b) reset every attribute defined by `h1` when I define `.titledimage h1` ?
c) just use a class name for `.titledimage header`, and leave 
   `h1`, `h2`, `h3` for 'traditional more logical headers' 
d) something else

I have figured out how to load each of them into different areas of flash, and after taking a memory dump everything looks like it is in the right place.</p>

<p>So when I do a reset it loads the boot, all the boot does at the moment is jump to the application. Debugging the boot, this all appears to work correctly. However the problems arrives after i've made the jump to the application, it just executes one instruction (assembly) and then jumps back to the boot. It should stay in the application indefinitely.</p>

<p>My question is then, where should I 'jump' to in the app? </p>

<p>It seems that there are a few potential spots, such as the interrupt vectors, the reset handler, the main function of the app. Actually I've tried all of those with no success.</p>

<p>Hopefully that makes sense, i'll update the question if not.</p>

<p>thanks for your help!
Richard</p>

<h2>Updates:</h2>

<ul>
<li>I had a play around in the debugger and manually changed the program counter to the main of the application, and well that worked a charm, so it makes me think there is something wrong with my jump, why doesn't the program counter keep going after the jump?</li>
<li>Actually it seems to be the PSR, the 'T' gets reset on the jump, if I set that again after the jump it continues on with the app as I desire</li>
<li>Ok found a solution, seems that you need to have the PC LSB set to 1 when you do a branch or it falls into the 'ARM' mode (32 bit instruction instead of 16 bit instructions like in the 'thumb' mode. Quite an obscure little problem, thanks for letting me share it with you! </li>

<blockquote>
  <p>JNDI</p>
  
  <p>Embedded JBoss components like connection pooling, EJB, JPA, and transactions make 
  extensive use of JNDI to publish services. Embedded JBoss overrides Tomcat's JNDI 
  implementation by layering itself on top of Tomcat's JNDI instantiation. There are a few > reasons for this:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>To avoid having to declare each and every one of these services within server.xml</li>
  <li>To allow seemeless integration of the java:comp namespace between web apps and 
  EJBs.</li>
  <li>Tomcat's JNDI implementation has a few critical bugs in it that hamper some JBoss 
  components ability to work</li>
  <li>We want to provide the option for you of remoting EJBs and other services that can > be remotely looked up</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone have any thoughts on how I can configure the JBoss naming service which according to the above quote is overriding Tomcat's JNDI implementation so that I can do a lookup on java:comp/env?  </p>

<p>Some messages include a placeholder that will be filled using <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">java.text.MessageFormat</a>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>search.summary = Your search for {0} found {1} items.
</code></pre>

<p>MessageFormat is annoying, because a single quote is a special character, despite being common in English text. You have to type two for a literal single quote:</p>

<pre><code>warning.item = This item''s {0} is not valid.
</code></pre>

<p>However, three-quarters of the application's 1000 or so messages do not include a placeholder. This means that we can output them directly, avoiding MessageFormat, and leave the single quotes alone:</p>

<pre><code>help.url = The web page's URL
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> should we use MessageFormat for all messages, for consistent syntax, or avoid MessageFormat where we can, so most messages do not need escaping?</p>

<p>There are clearly pros and cons either way.</p>

<p>Note that the API documentation for MessageFormat acknowledges the problem and suggests a non-solution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rules for using quotes within
  message format patterns unfortunately
  have shown to be somewhat confusing.
  In particular, it isn't always obvious
  to localizers whether single quotes
  need to be doubled or not. Make sure
  to inform localizers about the rules,
  and tell them (for example, by using
  comments in resource bundle source
  files) which strings will be processed
  by MessageFormat.</p>

<li>How does the Kernel know which interpreter to launch?</li>

<p>I recently wanted to write a wrapper around <em>/usr/bin/env</em> because my CGI Environment does not allow me to set the <em>PATH</em> variable, except globally (which of course sucks!).</p>

<p>So I thought, ""OK. Let's set PREPENDPATH and set <em>PATH</em> in a wrapper around env."". The resulting script (here called <em>env.1</em>) looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/env PATH=$PREPENDPATH:$PATH $*
</code></pre>

<p>which looks like it should work. I checked how they both react, after setting PREPENDPATH:</p>

<pre><code>$ which /usr/bin/env python
/usr/bin/env
/usr/bin/python

$ which /usr/bin/env.1 python
/usr/bin/env
/home/pi/prepend/bin/python
</code></pre>

<p>Look absolutely <em>perfect</em>! So far, so good. But look what happens to ""Hello World!"".</p>

<pre><code># Shebang is #!/usr/bin/env python
$ test-env.py
Hello World!

# Shebang is #!/usr/bin/env.1 python
$ test-env.1.py
Warning: unknown mime-type for ""Hello World!"" -- using ""application/*""
Error: no such file ""Hello World!""
</code></pre>

<p>I guess I am missing something pretty fundamental about UNIX.</p>

<p>I'm pretty lost, even after looking at the source code of the original <em>env</em>. It sets the environment and launches the program (or so it seems to me...).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Posting the message works find, but when the receiving application calls GetMessageText, the string contains ""\0\0\0\0"" (which is NOT what the sending application sent).</p>

<p>I'm calling it like this:</p>

<pre><code>RegisteredMsg.PostUpdateMsg(""test"");
</code></pre>

<p>and receiving it like this:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void WndProc(ref Message msg)
{
    base.WndProc(ref msg);
    if (Convert.ToUInt32(msg.Msg) == RegisteredMsg.RegisteredMessage)
    {
        string text = RegisteredMsg.GetMessageText(msg);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT #0</p>

<p>I also tried it this way, and all of the bytes in the received array are '\0':</p>

<pre><code>//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
public static void PostUpdateMsg(string text)
{
    byte[] array  = StringToByteArray(text);
    IntPtr lpData = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(array.Length);
    Marshal.Copy(array, 0, lpData, array.Length);
    IntPtr lpLength = new IntPtr(text.Length);
    if (!PostMessage(m_handleRef, RegisteredMessage, lpData, lpLength))
    {
        throw new Exception(""Could not post message."");
    }
}

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------public static string GetMessageText(Message msg)
{
    string text   = """";
    int    length = msg.LParam.ToInt32();
    byte[] array  = new byte[length];
    Marshal.Copy(msg.WParam, array, 0, length);
    text          = RegisteredMsg.ByteArrayToString(array);
    return text;
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT #1 </p>

<p>I also called this method from PostUpdateMessage, just to make sure what I was sending was what I thought I was sending:</p>

<pre><code>private static void TestIntPtr(IntPtr ptr, int length)
{
    string text = """";
    byte[] array = new byte[length];
    Marshal.Copy(ptr, array, 0, length);
    text       = ByteArrayToString(array);  // &lt;&lt;------------
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the indicated line is executed, the <code>text</code> variablle is indeed = ""test"", so I'm doing it right on the sending side. It looks like the memory is getting cleared before it gets to the receiving application.</p>

<p>EDIT #2</p>

<p>I also tried making the <code>IntPtr</code> (pointing to the string I want to send) global to its parent class to make sure it would live long enough to be viable at the other end. No joy there, either.</p>

<p>EDIT #3 </p>

<p>I also reverted back to using the <code>StringToHGlobalAuto</code>, and ran the ""is it still okay in the sending app"" test (see Edit #1 above), and that test proved that the way I was building the <code>IntPtr</code> was fine as well.</p>

"160376","1","160538","","2008-10-02 00:30:38","","27","5951","<p>I've noticed that just in the last year or so, many major websites have made the same change to the way their pages are structured. Each has moved their Javascript files from being hosted on the same domain as the page itself (or a subdomain of that), to being hosted on a differently named domain.</p>

<h2>It's not simply parallelization</h2>

<p>Now, there is a well known technique of spreading the components of your page across multiple domains to parallelize downloading.  <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#split"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yahoo recommends it</a> as do many others.  For instance, <strong>www.example.com</strong> is where your HTML is hosted, then you put images on <strong>images.example.com</strong> and javascripts on <strong>scripts.example.com</strong>. This gets around the fact that most browsers limit the number of simultaneous connections per server in order to be good net citizens.</p>

<p>The above is <em>not</em> what I am talking about.</p>

<h2>It's not simply redirection to a content delivery network (or maybe it is--see bottom of question)</h2>

<p>What I am talking about is hosting Javascripts specifically on an entirely different domain. Let me be specific. Just in the last year or so I've noticed that:</p>

<p><strong>youtube.com</strong> has moved its .JS files to <strong>ytimg.com</strong></p>

<p><strong>cnn.com</strong> has moved its .JS files to <strong>cdn.turner.com</strong></p>

<p><strong>weather.com</strong> has moved its .JS files to <strong>j.imwx.com</strong></p>

<p>Now, I know about content delivery networks like <a href=""http://www.akamai.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Akamai</a> who specialize in outsourcing this for large websites.  (The name ""cdn"" in Turner's special domain clues us in to the importance of this concept here).</p>

<p>But note with these examples, each site has its own specifically registered domain for this purpose, and its not the domain of a content delivery network or other infrastructure provider. In fact, if you try to load the home page off most of these script domains, they usually redirect back to the main domain of the company.  And if you reverse lookup the IPs involved, they <em>sometimes</em> appear point to a CDN company's servers, sometimes not.</p>

<h2>Why do I care?</h2>

<p>Having formerly worked at two different security companies, I have been made paranoid of malicious Javascripts.</p>

<p>As a result, I follow the practice of whitelisting sites that I will allow Javascript (and other active content such as Java) to run on. As a result, to make a site like <strong>cnn.com</strong> work properly, I have to manually put <strong>cnn.com</strong> into a list. It's a pain in the behind, but I prefer it over the alternative.</p>

<p>When folks used things like <strong>scripts.cnn.com</strong> to parallelize, that worked fine with appropriate wildcarding.  And when folks used subdomains off the CDN company domains, I could just permit the CDN company's main domain with a wildcard in front as well and kill many birds with one stone (such as *.edgesuite.net and *.akamai.com).</p>

<p>Now I have discovered that (as of 2008) this is not enough. Now I have to poke around in the source code of a page I want to whitelist, and figure out what ""secret"" domain (or domains) that site is using to store their Javascripts on.  In some cases I've found I have to permit three different domains to make a site work.</p>

<h2>Why did all these major sites start doing this?</h2>

<p>EDIT: OK <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/160376/why-move-your-javascript-files-to-a-different-main-domain-that-you-also-own#160451"">as ""onebyone"" pointed out</a>, it does appear to be related to CDN delivery of content.  So let me modify the question slightly based on his research...</p>

<p>Why is <strong>weather.com</strong> using <strong>j.imwx.com</strong> instead of <strong>twc.vo.llnwd.net</strong>?</p>

<p>Why is <strong>youtube.com</strong> using <strong>s.ytimg.com</strong> instead of <strong>static.cache.l.google.com</strong>?</p>

I would argue that there are better techniques than others, but that's another question.</p>

<p>I'm curious to know, what is the typical impact of a log4net DebugFormat-type call on your applications. I'm going to leave out variables like number of log statements per lines of code, etc, because I'm just looking for anything that you've seen in the real world.</p>

<p>And, I am aware of the simple technique of adding a guard clause to long evaluation statements eg:</p>

Does anyone have a theory on the rationale for this limitation? For instance, it would be nice to be able to declare const values of other types, such as IntPtr.</p>

<p>I believe that the concept of <code>const</code> is actually syntactic sugar in C#, and that it just replaces any uses of the name with the literal value. For instance, given the following declaration, any reference to Foo would be replaced with ""foo"" at compile time.</p>

<pre><code>const string Foo = ""foo"";

<p>For our web application, we have 3 systems: dev, QA, and production.  Right now, a third party is maintaining the code, but soon it will be in our hands.  We will have separate build environments for each stage.  Also, we use RAD for code development, so there'll actually be a primary step, test/sandbox.</p>

<p>Ideally, we'd like to somehow isolate repositories for each stage, such that we check out from DEV, make some changes, test them locally, and check them back into DEV.  If everything is ok on Dev, we will check into QA, and so on.</p>

<p>Should we have separate repositories for each, or would this fall under 'branching', where we'd have a separate branch for dev, QA, and prod.  Could you also provide the best means of implementing whatever the ideal route is?</p>

<li>Is it possible to update the child ListViews when the master ListView ScrollBar is dragged?</li>

As near as I can tell right now they expect each message from us to come in a separate Ethernet frame! They seem to have problems when messages are split across Ethernet frames. </p>

<p>We are on the local network with the device, and there are no routers between us (just a switch).</p>

<p>We are, of course, trying to force them to fix their system, but that may not end up being feasible.</p>

<p>I've already set TCP_NODELAY on my sockets (I connect to them), but that only helps if I don't try to send more than one message at a time. If I have several outgoing messages in a row, those messages tend to end up in one or two Ethernet frames, which causes trouble on the other system.</p>

<p>I can generally avoid the problem by using a timer to avoid sending messages too close together, but that obviously limits our throughput. Further, if I turn the time down too low, I risk network congestion holding up packet transmits and ending up allowing more than one of my messages into the same packet.</p>

<p>Is there any way that I can tell whether the driver has data queued or not? Is there some way I can force the driver to send independent write calls in independent transport layer packets? I've had a look through the socket(7) and tcp(7) man pages and I didn't find anything. It may just be that I don't know what I'm looking for. </p>

<p>Obviously, UDP would be one way out, but again, I don't think we can make the other end change anything much at this point.</p>

<p>What is a good size to make the stack for each thread run on the system? Should I try to design the system in such a way that the stack can be extended automatically if the maximum length is reached?</p>

<p>I think if I remember correctly that a page in RAM is 4k or 4096 bytes and that just doesn't seem like a lot to me. I can definitely see times, especially when using lots of recursion, that I would want to have more than 1000 integars in RAM at once. Now, the real solution would be to have the program doing this by using <code>malloc</code> and manage its own memory resources, but really I would like to know the user opinion on this.</p>

<p>Is 4k big enough for a stack with modern computer programs? Should the stack be bigger than that? Should the stack be auto-expanding to accommodate any types of sizes? I'm interested in this both from a practical developer's standpoint and a security standpoint.</p>

<p>Is 4k too big for a stack? Considering normal program execution, especially from the point of view of classes in C++, I notice that good source code tends to <code>malloc/new</code> the data it needs when classes are created, to minimize the data being thrown around in a function call.</p>

<p>What I haven't even gotten into is the size of the processor's cache memory. Ideally, I think the stack would reside in the cache to speed things up and I'm not sure if I need to achieve this, or if the processor can handle it for me.

However, I have a one semi-large project whose maintenance / extensibility has reached its end of a life cycle. I was weighing on different PHP frameworks (there were no when the project originated), since it is the way to go for this project, and I came to conclusion the ebst option would be to do it with Zend Framework.</p>

<ul>
<li>Symfony seemed to complicated (I don't like setting up database model as that</li>
<li>CakePHP seemed murky</li>
<li>Igniter I liked at first, but then it seemed to me it is more like Zend with less features and no Zend behind it</li>
<li>Zend I like the system of that I can use only what I like and not being tied into a specific directory structure, and of course there is Zend behind it. Performance is what potentially bothers me</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, after this little rationale behind choosing Zend, there are several things I see as a deal breaker when choosing a framework. </p>

<ul>
<li>I haven't used ORM in the past because I am more than comfortable writing SQL directly, so I still need to be convinced to use ORM</li>
<li>Not too much abstraction going on from the guts</li>
<li>Flexible directory structure</li>
</ul>

<p>
As long as this project is going to be written anew, I just as might write it in Python/Django, since I am quite familiar with Python, but not with Django. So, I would like to know if there is someone that worked with both Zend Framework and Django frameworks and if can outline a few key point differences?
</p>

<p>
I must also say that this project is made as a standard site/admin dual project. That is, it is basically two sites in one. One is for frontend and users, other is for data administration in the backend. I must and will build backend on my own, some scaffolding methods would be cool, but full automatic scaffolding is as good as nothing in this case.
</p>

<p>
 I am still quite not sure how one approaches building basically two applications within a directory structure of, what is supposed to be, one application. Do you just make two separate applications and rely on URL scheme from there on to separate them? www.example.com and all of the /* being one application and www.example.com/admin/* being a second application.
</p>

<p> 
Sorry for the long question(s), but as you can see - everything is pretty much related to one problem - I need to start a project anew, it has already established database+data which I can remodel, but would like to keep that kind of work at minimum.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Ok, thank you everybody - looks like I'll try and implement this stuff with Zend, gives me most flexibility out of the package (I did tests with both), and we'll see how it goes.

That part works fine - I can run the Python web server application from the command line and I can have clients connect to it and get data back. At the moment, to run the web server I have to be logged in to our server as the administrator user and I have to manually start the web server. I want to have the web server automatically start on system start as a service and run in the background.</p>

<p>Using code from <a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576451/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ActiveState</a>'s site and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32404/can-i-run-a-python-script-as-a-service-in-windows-how"">StackOverflow</a>, I have a pretty good idea of how to go about creating a service, and I think I've got that bit sorted - I can install and start my web server as a Windows service. I can't, however, figure out how to stop the service again. My web server is created from a BaseHTTPServer:</p>

<pre><code>server = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('', 8081), SIMSAPIServerHandler)
server.serve_forever()
</code></pre>

<p>The serve_forever() call, naturally enough, makes the web server sit in an infinite loop and wait for HTTP connections (or a ctrl-break keypress, not useful for a service). I get the idea from the example code above that your main() function is supposed to sit in an infinite loop and only break out of it when it comes accross a ""stop"" condition. My main calls serve_forever(). I have a SvcStop function:</p>

<pre><code>def SvcStop(self):
    self.ReportServiceStatus(win32service.SERVICE_STOP_PENDING)
    exit(0)
</code></pre>

<p>Which seems to get called when I do ""python myservice stop"" from the command line (I can put a debug line in there that produces output to a file) but doesn't actually exit the whole service - subsequent calls to ""python myservice start"" gives me an error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error starting service: An instance of
  the service is already running.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and subsequent calls to stop gives me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error stopping service: The service
  cannot accept control messages at this
  time. (1061)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think I need either some replacement for serve_forever (serve_until_stop_received, or whatever) or I need some way of modifying SvcStop so it stops the whole service.</p>

I don't really see a downside to good, well thought out syntactic sugar.  Why do some people basically think that syntactic sugar is at best superfluous and at worst something to be avoided?</p>

<p>Edit:  I didn't want to name names, but since people asked, it seems like most C++ and Java programmers, for example, frankly don't care about their language's utter lack of syntactic sugar.  In a lot of cases, it's not necessarily that they just like other parts of the language enough to make the lack of sugar worth the tradeoff, it's that they really <strong>don't care</strong>.  Also, Lisp programmers seem almost proud of their language's strange notation (I won't call it syntax because it technically isn't), though in this case, it's more understandable because it allows Lisp's metaprogramming facilities to be as powerful as they are.</p>

To cut down on the page's length, I only want to display a teaser (the first 200 words / 600 letters of the article) and then display a ""more..."" link, that, when clicked, will expand the rest of the article in a jQuery/Javascript way. Now, I've all that figured out and even found the following helper method on some paste page, which will make sure, that the news article (string) is not chopped up right in the middle of a word:</p>

<pre><code> def shorten (string, count = 30)

<p>Ironically, running 'svnadmin verify repository_path' also returns the same error. It happens on existing working copies and brand new working copies too.</p>

<p>Anybody had and solved this problem before? We've been using svn for a number of years and know our way around pretty well, but this one has us stumped!</p>

The class itself seems to me to be, well, a hack.  It seems to me that there are other, better means of solving a problem where a WeakReference is used in examples I've seen.  What's the canonical example of where you've really got to use a WeakReference?  Aren't we trying to get <i>farther</i> away from this type of behavior and use of this class?  </p>

1) All hidden input elements should be affected without removing standard decorators.
2) This should happen WITHOUT having to specify it on a per-element basis.</p>

<p>All I need is for a CSS class to be attached to the DT &amp; DD tags IF the element type is Zend_Form_Element_Hidden.</p>

<p>I've tried creating custom HtmlTag, DtDdWrapper, and FormElement decorators, but haven't been able to figure out how to do it.</p>

<p>By default they appear this way:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""whatever"" value=""bling"" /&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

In Visual Studio 2008, I can connect to and commit the website files to the server successfully using ""IP of server/svn/domainname folder"".

<p>My question is how could we test the website I just uploaded? On our server all our websites are stored in ""C:\sites\domainname"" folders. In IIS we map that folder to the domain name so when someone types in domainname.com they get the right website. How do I config the Visual SVN server setup to allow me use the ""C:\sites\domainname"" setup we currently have?</p>

Someone else has provided the Excel workbook with the macro.  The macro grabs updated values from an external database, and performs some fairly complex massaging of the data.  I need the results from this massaging, and I don't really want to duplicate this in my Python script, if I can avoid it.  So, it would be great if I could just invoke the macro from my script, and grab the massaged results.</p>

<p>Everything I know about COM I learned from ""Python Programming on Win32"".  Good book, but not enough for my task at hand.  I searched, but haven't found any good examples on how to do this.  Does anyone have any good examples, or perhaps some skeleton code of how to address/invoke the VBA macro?  A general reference (book, web link, etc) on the Excel COM interfaces would also help here.  Thanks.</p>

<p>I am also learning Qt4 with Ruby which is where this code originates from, i translated it from Ruby to Python. In the Ruby version the LCDRange class is defined as this:</p>

<pre><code>class LCDRange &lt; Qt::Widget

  slots 'setValue(int)'

<p>So my guess was that i have to somehow declare the existence of the custom slot?</p>

Now, I don't know much about either Windows APIs or VB(A) programming, but the ""standard"" Windows file dialog I see most often in Microsoft applications would seem like an obvious choice, but it does not seem to be easily available from Outlook's macros.</p>

<p>Ideally, the directory picker should at least allow to manually paste a file path/URI as a starting point for navigation, since I sometimes already have an Explorer window open for the same directory.</p>

<p><em>What are the best choices for directory pickers in Outlook macros?</em></p>

<p>Two things I already tried and did not find totally satisfactory are (the code is simplified and w/o error handling and probably also runs in older Outlook versions):</p>

<p>1) Using <code>Shell.Application</code> which does not allow me to actually paste a starting point via the clipboard or do other operations like renaming folders:</p>

<pre><code>  Set objShell = CreateObject(""Shell.Application"")
  sMsg = ""Select a Folder""
  cBits = 1
  xRoot = 17
  Set objBFF = objShell.BrowseForFolder(0, sMsg, cBits, xRoot)
  path = objBFF.self.Path
</code></pre>

<p>2) Using the <code>Office.FileDialog</code> from <code>Microsoft Word 12.0 Object Library</code> (via tools/references) and then using Word's file dialog, which somehow takes forever on my Vista system to appear and does not always actually bring Word to the foreground. Instead, sometimes Outlook is blocked and the file dialog is left lingering somewhere in the background:</p>

<pre><code>  Dim objWord As Word.Application
  Dim dlg As Office.FileDialog
  Set objWord = GetObject(, ""Word.Application"")
  If objWord Is Nothing Then
     Set objWord = CreateObject(""Word.Application"")
  End If
  objWord.Activate
  Set dlg = objWord.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFolderPicker)
  path = dlg.SelectedItems(1)

for (Int64 i = 3; i &lt; 600851475143; i=i+2)
{
    lst.Add(i);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks</p>

I've signed on to the Microsoft BizSpark program sometime earlier a month or two ago, and has activated the MSDN subscription that came with the program.</p>

<p>The subscriber and keys section of the site was accessible after I signed in to the MSDN portal.</p>

<p>I wanted to subscribe to the MSDN Magazine as well, and was directed to sign on via a designated link on the Manage My Subscription page. The said link could not be found. Looking at the help page, there was supposed to be this Online Concierge link that I can click on to get live help. Again, it was supposed to be on the Manage My Subscription page, but was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Is the MSDN subscription provided via the BizSpark program supposed to be ""crippled"" (provided only partially)? Also, do we have an option to get discs delivered instead of having only downloads, similar to the retail MSDN subscriptions?</p>

<p>Edit: It's strange - I wonder if the MSDN folks read StackOverflow, because I just signed into my subscriber downloads area and I found a new link to ""MSDN Magazine Subscription"" under the ""Subscription Benefits"" box on the Subscription Home page of MSDN.</p>

<p>I filled in the request form and submitted it successfully, not sure what's supposed to happen now 'cause the submission page did not provide much detail. Fingers crossed! =)</p>

<p>My first thought was to just shuffle some bits. When I showed the client a sample sequence, he complained that subsequent obfuscOrderNumbers were increasing until they hit a ""shuffle"" point (point where the lower-order bits came into play). He wants the obfuscOrderNumbers to be as random-seeming as possible.</p>

<p>My next thought was to deterministically seed a linear congruential pseudo-random-number generator and then take the actualOrderNumber th value. But in that case, I need to worry about collisions -- the client wants an algorithm that is guaranteed not to collide in at least 10^7 cycles. </p>

<p>My third thought was ""eh, just encrypt the darn thing,"" but if I use a stock encryption library, I'd have to post-process it to get the 8-or-9 digits only requirement.</p>

<p>Three entities:
Cust (custid, custname)
Ord (ordid, custid, orddate, ...)
Charge (chargeid, ordid, chargetype, chargevalue...)</p>

<p>Think of a ""charge"" as an optional cost (a special charge) associated with an order -- some orders have them, some don't.</p>

<p>Model was auto-generated from views (.dsv) which accurately indicate the relationships between cust and ord, and between ord and charge. I noted that when designing the view relationships there was no kind of option to indicate (for example) that the relationship should be treated as a ""left join"".  </p>

<p>Now I jump to Report Builder 2 (RB2) to design a report based on this model.  My goal is to simply list for each order: customer name, order date, charge type, charge value (i.e., order row would repeat if it had more than one charge type).  I want ALL orders listed, even if an order doesn't have any charges -- what I would consider a ""left join"" in the traditional sense.</p>

<p>I use RB2's Query Designer to create the dataset, and merely select (i.e., double-click) the entities I want as fields in the report: custname, orddate, chargetype, chargeval.  I then create a simple table in the report based on this dataset.</p>

<p>When running the report, I get only those orders which actually have charges.  I was rather hoping to get all orders.  Is there a way I can specify that?</p>

I'm starting to notice that I need to call the IoC container in different places in my code to create new objects. This dependency on the container makes my code harder to maintain.</p>

<p>There are two solutions I've used to solve this problem</p>

<p>I tried to create abstract factories as wrappers around the container that I could inject into parts of my application that need to create objects. This works but has some drawbacks because castle has a hard time injecting it's own container as a dependency. So I have to do that by hand, this kind of defeats the whole purpose of the IoC container.</p>

<p>I have used the main applicationcontroller class to wrap the IoC container and work as a central factory/repository. This was quite succesfull but this class is getting too big and acts like a central god-object, almost every other objects has a reference to it.</p>

<p>Both solutions sort of work but both have their drawbacks. So I'm curious if other people had the same problem and have found better solutions.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>edit</em>
The problem isn't for object A that depends on object B. Here I usually just use constructor injection and everything works. Sometimes I have objects of type A that need to create a variable number of other objects of type B during their lifetime. I'm not sure how to do this.</p>

<p>@Blair Conrad: The maintenance issues are not severe until now. I had some classes depend on the container object calling container.Resolve&lt;>. And I don't want to have my code depending on what I think is infrastructure. I'm still trying things out so I noticed I had to change a lot of code when switching from ninject to castle for this project.</p>

<p>@flowers: Hmm. I like your fists solution. It combines the things that work from both solutions I've tried. I think I was still thinking too much in objects and not enough in interfaces/responsibilities. 
I tried purpose built factories but I would like to have them use the container behind the scenes to create the objects and I havn't found out how I can DI the container into objects in a clean way.</p>
