<p><strong>What are the feelings about DB BLOB vs Filesystem for this scenario?</strong> How do clients go with caching images from the DB vs from the filesystem?</p>

<p>If BLOBs stored in the DB are the way to go - is there anything I should know about <em>where</em> to store them? Since I imagine that a majority of my users won't be uploading a picture, should I create a <code>user_pics</code> table to (outer) join to the regular <code>users</code> table when needed?</p>

<p>I want to open a temporary file which will always be deleted upon program termination.  I could understand that in the case of a program crash it may not be practical to guarantee this, but in any other case I'd like it to work.</p>

<p>I know about RAII.  I know about signals.  I know about <code>atexit(3)</code>.  I know I can open the file and delete it immediately and the file will remain accessible until the file descriptor is closed (which even handles a crash).  None of these seem like a complete and straightforward solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>RAII: been there, done that: I have an object whose destructor deletes the file, but the destructor is not called if the program is terminated by a signal.</li>
<li>signals: I'm writing a low-level library which makes registering a signal handler a tricky proposition.  For example, what if the application uses signals itself?  I don't want to step on any toes.  I might consider some clever use of <code>sigaction(2)</code> to cope...but haven't put enough thought into this possibility yet.</li>
<li><code>atexit(3)</code>: apparently useless, since it isn't called during abnormal termination (e.g. via a signal).</li>
<li>preemptive <code>unlink(2)</code>: this is pretty good except that I need the file to remain visible in the filesystem (otherwise the system is harder to monitor/troubleshoot).</li>
</ol>

<p>What would you do here?</p>

<p><strong>Further Explanation</strong></p>

<p>I elided one detail in my original post which I now realize I should have included.  The ""file"" in this case is not strictly a normal file, but rather is a POSIX Message Queue.  I create it via <code>mq_open()</code>.  It can be closed via <code>mq_close()</code> or <code>close()</code> (the former is an alias for the latter on my system).  It can be removed from the system via <code>mq_unlink()</code>.  All of this makes it analogous to a regular file, <em>except</em> that I cannot choose the directory in which the file resides.  This makes the current most popular answer (placing the file in <code>/tmp</code>) unworkable, because the ""file"" is created by the system in a virtual filesystem with very limited capacity.  (I've mounted the virtual filesystem in <code>/dev/mqueue</code>, following the example in <code>man mq_overview</code>) .</p>

<p>This also explains why I need the name to remain visible (making the immediate-unlink approach unworkable): the ""file"" must be shared between two or more processes.</p>

<p>I've seen it used in our team's code once or twice.  In your experience, what does this construct enable?  Do other pointer languages have similar constructs?

<p>A) Take the code from the app, rebrand it by changing the name and/or logo and, <em>without</em> modifying a single line of code, sell it to people as a hosted service?  Would I have to say something like ""We are using <code>Project X</code>"" with a link to its site?  Or does nobody have to know that I'm using an open-source application unless I want them to?</p>

<p>B) Change the structure of the application, add in my own stuff (an extra module that the original app doesn't have, for instance) and not merge the code back into the main branch <strong>if</strong> the app will only ever be hosted, and not distributed to people?</p>

<p>C) Scrap the front-end entirely and write my own using another technology (Flex, for instance) but use the existing code (possibly modified as with scenario B above) as the back-end?</p>

<p>Can I do any of these?  All of them?  I'm really not 100% sure but it seems a shame to have to reinvent the wheel if there's an open source app that already does most of what my project would do; it seems a lot easier to be able to take that and add onto it to provide a better solution.</p>

<p>I'd like to be able to do this without injecting any reference to <code>ServletConfig</code> or anything similiar to my Factory - the code should be able to run ok outside of a Servlet Container.</p>

<p>This might sound a little bit uncommon, but I'd like for this component I'm working on to be able to be packaged with one of our webapps, and also be versatile enough to be packaged with some of our command-line tools without requiring a new properties file just for my component - so I was hoping to piggyback on top of other configuration files such as web.xml.</p>

<p>If I recall correctly, .NET has something like <code>Request.GetCurrentRequest()</code> to get a reference to the currently executing <code>Request</code> - but since this is a Java app I'm looking for something simliar that could be used to gain access to <code>ServletConfig</code>.</p>

All of the examples I've seen of this, however, deal with refactoring implementation - changing an algorithm with a more efficient one, for example. </p>

<p>I find that refactoring architecture is a lot more common in the early stages where the design is still being worked out. Interfaces change, new classes are added &amp; deleted, even the behavior of a function could change slightly (I thought I needed it to do this, but it actually needs to do that), etc... But if each test case is tightly coupled to these unstable classes, wouldn't you have to be constantly rewriting your test cases each time you change a design? </p>

<p>Under what situations in TDD is it okay to alter and delete test cases? How can you be sure that altering the test cases don't break them? Plus it seems that having to synchronize a comprehensive test suite with constantly changing code would be a pain. I understand that the unit test suite could help tremendously during maintenance, once the software is built, stable, and functioning, but that's late in the game wheras TDD is supposed to help early on as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, would a good book on TDD and/or refactoring address these sort of issues? If so, which would you recommend?</p>

I needed a way to have the one tab blue and the other gray depending what tab I was on.  What I hit against was <strong>tab1</strong> would stay blue even when I clicked on <strong>tab2</strong>, just was funky until this fixed it.

<p>2) If I hardcode the values in the beginning and run the app it works. I only get the said error when I try to reference the values from xml. </p>

<p>3) I have searched quite a bit on this topic on google and stackexchange and have tried several approaches suggested on the stackexchange links such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>creating and calling a method like below. I get that same error inside this method.</p>

<pre><code>public String getStringResourceByName(String resourceName) {
    String packageName = ""com.android.example.helloworld"";
    Log.i(""-- package name --"",packageName);
    int resId = this.getResources().getIdentifier(resourceName, ""string"", packageName);
    String resName = getString(resId);
    Log.i(""-- resource name -- "",resName);
    return resName;
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Using MainActivity.this specifically in the above method </p>

<pre><code>public String getStringResourceByName(String resourceName) {
    String packageName = ""com.android.example.helloworld"";
    Log.i(""-- package name --"",packageName);
    int resId = MainActivity.this.getResources().getIdentifier(resourceName, ""string"", packageName);
    String resName = getString(resId);
    Log.i(""-- resource name -- "",resName);
    return resName;
 }

<p>All of the changes throw the same error back at me.</p></li>

<p>I want to have a method where I can say ""if it goes bad, come back with this type of Exception"", right?</p>

<p>For example, something like (<strong>and this doesn't work</strong>):</p>

<pre><code>    static ExType TestException&lt;ExType&gt;(string message) where ExType:Exception
    {
        Exception ex1 = new Exception();
        ExType ex = new Exception(message);
        return ex;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now whats confusing me is that we <em>KNOW</em> that the generic type is going to be of an Exception type due to the <em>where</em> clause. However, the code fails because we cannot implicitly cast <em>Exception</em> to <em>ExType</em>. We cannot explicitly convert it either, such as:</p>

<pre><code>    static ExType TestException&lt;ExType&gt;(string message) where ExType:Exception
    {
        Exception ex1 = new Exception();
        ExType ex = (ExType)(new Exception(message));
        return ex;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>As that fails too.. So <strong>is this kind of thing possible?</strong> I have a strong feeling its going to be real simple, but I am having a tough day with the old noggin, so cut me some slack :P</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Thanks for the responses guys, looks like it wasn't me being a <em>complete</em> idiot! ;)</p>

<p>OK, so <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41397/asking-a-generic-method-to-throw-specific-exception-type-on-fail#41398"">Vegard</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41397/asking-a-generic-method-to-throw-specific-exception-type-on-fail#41404"">Sam</a> got me on to the point where I could instantiate the correct type, but then obviously got stuck because the <em>message</em> param is read-only following instantiation.</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41397/asking-a-generic-method-to-throw-specific-exception-type-on-fail#41408"">Matt</a> hit the nail right on the head with his response, I have tested this and all works fine. Here is the example code:</p>

<pre><code>    static ExType TestException&lt;ExType&gt;(string message) where ExType:Exception, new ()

<p>My current approach is, inside the Mailing class, check whether HttpContext.Current is null, and if so, use a separate method.<br>
The separate method I'm looking at right now (after resigning myself to the fact that there's nothing better) is to have the path to the .resx file of the website stored in the app.config file, and somehow read that file.<br>
I started trying with System.Resources.ResourceReader, but it looks like it wants a .resources file, not a .resx one.</p>

<p>I have a method which executes the following code:</p>

<pre><code>IList&lt;Gig&gt; gigs = GetGigs().WithArtist(artistId).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>The GetGigs() method gets Gigs from my database via LinqToSql...</p>

<p>So, when GetGigs().WithArtist(artistId).ToList() is executed I get the following exception:</p>

<pre><code>Member access 'ListenTo.Shared.DO.Artist Artist' of 'ListenTo.Shared.DO.Act' not legal on type 'System.Collections.Generic.List`1[ListenTo.Shared.DO.Act] 
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the extension function ""WithArtist"" looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    public static IQueryable&lt;Gig&gt; WithArtist(this IQueryable&lt;Gig&gt; qry, Guid artistId)
    {
        return from gig in qry
               where gig.Acts.Any(act =&gt; (null != act.Artist) &amp;&amp; (act.Artist.ID == artistId))
               orderby gig.StartDate
               select gig;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If I replace the GetGigs() method with a method that constructs a collection of gigs in <strong>code</strong> (rather than from the DB via LinqToSQL) I do NOT get the exception.</p>

<p>So I'm fairly sure the problem is with my LinqToSQl code rather than the object structure.</p>

<p>However, I have NO IDEA why the LinqToSQl version isnt working, so I've included all the associated code below. Any help would be VERY gratefully receivced!!</p>

Sure, I can use the out-of-the-box RichTextEditor and TextArea controls, but both tend to choke on displaying and manipulating simple markup (e.g., single or absent quotes on attributes, image alignment, etc.), and the content it generates by default, while beautifully rendered in the Flash player, usually looks ridiculous in the browser -- an important factor to me, since I'd like to continue publishing RSS.</p>

<p>I know there are a couple of RichTextEditor derivatives out there, but before heading down the road with any of them, or down the alternative road of manipulating the content manually, I figured I'd poll the group here first, to see whether anyone's tackled this problem before; it seems like it has to be a fairly common use case.</p>

However, this causes some problems.</p>

<p>In some cases, a DOM node should only be visible when Javascript is enabled in the browser.  In other cases, it should only be visible when disabled.  Take for instance a submit button on a form that has a drop down with an onchange handler that auto-submits (using JQuery's form plugin):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method=""post"" action="".""&gt;
    &lt;label for=""id_state""&gt;State:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;select name=""state"" id=""id_state"" onchange=""$(this.form).ajaxSubmit(ajax_submit_handler);""&gt;
        &lt;option value=""AL""&gt;Alabama&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option value=""AK""&gt;Alaska&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;input class=""with_js_disabled"" type=""submit"" value=""OK"" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $(document).ready(function()
    {
        $("".with_js_disabled"").hide();
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When Javascript is enabled, the submit button is not required (due to the onchange handler).  However, JQuery's $(document).ready function (and the more direct document.onload) is only called after the page has been fully loaded and rendered - hence, the submit button is initially displayed and a ""flash"" occurs when the Javascript is executed and the node's display is set to ""none"".</p>

<p>I've accepted this as the cost of doing business, and haven't found a way around it.  But is there a technique I'm not aware of that will minimize the effect, or even outright eliminate it?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>The <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> solution mentioned by many people below seems promising, but isn't working for me on Safari.  However Prestaul's 2nd suggestion works beautifully:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
        document.body.className += ' has_js';
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;!-- the rest of your page --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This can then be styled using straight CSS:</p>

<pre><code>body .js_enabled_only { display: none; }
body .js_disabled_only { display: block; }
body.has_js .js_enabled_only { display: block; }
body.has_js .js_disabled_only { display: none; }
</code></pre>

<p>This second line is just for reference and can (and should) be removed to avoid circumstances where your element shouldn't be display:block.  Likewise, you may need different variations on the third line for other display styles.  But this solution is nice and clean, IMO, and in my tests entirely eliminates the flicker effect.</p>

I'm interested in binding to an NSDictionaryController (I don't think I need an intermediate NSArrayController but if that is the best way, I'm open to it). </p>

<p>I've created a controller object that has a property 'db' which has a property 'species' which is an NSMutableDictionary. The 'species' dictionary has ID's for keys and Species objects for values. Species objects have a description property. In InterfaceBuilder, I've created MyController, NSDictionaryController, and an NSPopupButton. I would like to populate the popup with Species.descriptions. When selected, I need access to the corresponding ID.</p>

<p>I've setup the NSDictionaryController to bind 'Content Dictionary' to MyController with Model Key Path 'db.species'. With NSPopupButton, so far I've bound 'Content Values' to NSDictionaryController with controller key 'arrangedObjects' and Model Key Path set to 'value.description'.</p>

<p>This seems to work getting the list populated. My main question is what the best way to wire up the selection is. Ideally, I would like to wire selection to the NSDictionaryController so that I can use the NSDictionaryController to access the selection. One reason for this is so that I can wire other controls to the NSDictionaryController to see the current selection. If not, should I wire to a property in MyController or something? Just looking for the best practices. I would like as much to be through the Interface Builder mechanisms so that I can easily reuse the model and controller design in another application with a different view.</p>

<p><strong>Update using Brian's answer as guidance:</strong></p>

<p>NSPopupButton:
bind Content to NSDictionaryController->arrangedObjects->value.description</p>

<p>bind Content Objects to NSDictionaryController->arrangedObjects->key</p>

<p>bind Selected Index to NSDictionaryController->selectionIndex</p>

<p>bind NSDictionaryController->db.species</p>

<p>I have 1 UINavigationController and 2 subclasses of UIViewController.</p>

<p>I have a MainWindow.xib file, a PersonListView.xib, and a PersonDetailView.xib.</p>

<p>The MainWindow.xib has the UINavigationController with the view linked over to the PersonListView.xib file.</p>

<p>The PersonListView.xib has the File's Owner listed as a PersonListViewController class.</p>

<p>I have some buttons on the PersonListView, along with labels and images.  All displays correctly.</p>

<p>When I try to link a button on the PersonListView to my PersonListViewController class, the button is not firing....</p>

<p>The result:
 <strong>* Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*</strong> -[UIViewController viewDetail]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x450d50'</p>

<p>If I go into the debug console and print-object 0x450d50, I get:</p>

<p>(gdb) print-object 0x450d50

(gdb) </p>

<p>The Interface Builder correctly shows the File's Owner as a PersonListViewController, so why would my button action (linked to the File's Owner) go to the superclass somehow?</p>

<p>EDIT1: Ok, what seems to be happening is that I wasn't getting an instance of the subclass unless, in my MainWindow.xib, I explicitly set the class of the view controller to my subclass.</p>

<p>There's still got to be something I'm missing, though, because surely I should be able to start up arbitrary subclasses of UIViewController just by swapping out the NIB file name from the main window?</p>

<p>EDIT2: (Response to Kevin)
That's not what I'm saying regarding the contents of a XIB.  </p>

<p>I have 3 XIBs:</p>

<p>MainWindow
PeopleListView
PeopleDetailView</p>

<p>The PeopleListView and PeopleDetailView each have an associated File's Owner that is a corresponding UIViewController subclass.  Obviously, I need my events to go to the right controller classes as I move from page to page...but if I can only use a default UIViewController or one subclass, that will be much more difficult?</p>

<p>I can get the correct effect in code by manually setting up the UINavigationController with the correct root, but I feel like there should be a better way through InterfaceBuilder.</p>

<p>EDIT3: (to Kendall)
I'm not using a tab bar.  The model is the same, though, that the view in my navigation controller has to be wired to a single subclass, which seems a bit icky.</p>

<p>EDIT4: (to lostintransit)
The PersonListViewController has the appropriate - (IBAction) viewDetail; method.  The problem is that I can't find a way, in my MainWindow.xib, to flag the view inside my UINavigationController as ""initially load this from PersonListView.xib, with a PersonListViewController as the view"" that wouldn't make it difficult to replace the PersonListView with a PersonDetailView.</p>

<p>The carp warning works fine - I am checking if an input parameter meets a certain condition - if it does not meet the condition, a warning is sent with carp and the module continues on using a default for the parameter instead of the one the calling program passed.  The warning is just to notify that a default parameter is being used instead of the passed in parameter.</p>

<p>My problem is with my test script.  My test script is sending in a bad parameter to the module, and I am trying to catch the warning message that comes back and make sure I got the correct warning message.</p>

<p>My module looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>else {
  carp ""value must be numeric - using default value"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>and my test script looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>eval {
  #call to my module
};
like (
    $@,
    qr/value must be numeric/,
    ""Should abort on non-numeric value""
);
</code></pre>

<p>When I run the test, I can see the warning (it must be going to STDERR) on the screen, but the contents of the $@ variable is '' - blank.</p>

<p>Here is the output from my test script:</p>

<pre><code>t/04bad_method_calls....ok 10/12value must be numeric - using default value at ...
#   Failed test 'Should abort on non-numeric value'
#   at t/04bad_method_calls.t line 98.
t/04bad_method_calls....NOK 12
#                   '' doesn't match '(?-xism:value must be numeric)'
# Looks like you failed 1 test of 12.
</code></pre>

<p>If I change the carp to a croak, my test script works - it catches the error message (but I only want to warn, not abort).</p>

<p>To be honest, I don't have the best understanding of eval - maybe that is not the best way to catch the warning output from carp.  I tried using $SIG{<strong>WARN</strong>}, but that was empty as well.</p>

<p>Is there any way to capture the output from carp?  It's not the biggest deal since this is just in my test script, but I'd still like to get my test script to work properly.</p>

Everything I've found so far either uses NetBeans, or they're running a one-file project in Eclipse (witch won't work for larger projects).

It provides syntax highlighting support, plus some ""snippets"". I can even use it to run simple hello world type JavaFX apps, but I cant seem to get it to automatically build multi-file JavaFX projects.

<p>Also, I found <a href=""http://jfx.wikia.com/wiki/Ant_task"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this site</a> that talks about what you can do to use a <em>javafxc</em> Ant task created by Sun(?), but I'm not having any luck trying to use what they talk about.</p>

<p>I've setup a cherrypy upload/POST handler for our receiver end.  I've managed to allow it to do arbitrary number of parameters using multipart/form-data.  However when we try to send the multipart-mixed data, we're not getting any processing.</p>

<pre><code>@cherrypy.expose
def upload(self, *args,**kwargs):
    """"""upload adapted from cherrypy tutorials

    We use our variation of cgi.FieldStorage to parse the MIME
    encoded HTML form data containing the file.""""""

    print args   
    print kwargs

    cherrypy.response.timeout = 1300

    lcHDRS = {}
    for key, val in cherrypy.request.headers.iteritems():
        lcHDRS[key.lower()] = val
    incomingBytes = int(lcHDRS['content-length'])

    print cherrypy.request.rfile 

    #etc..etc...
</code></pre>

<p>So, when submitting multipart/form-data, args and kwargs are well defined.<br>
args are the form fields, kwargs=hash of vars and values.
When I submit multipart/mixed, args and kwargs are empty, and I just have cherrypy.request.rfile as the raw POST information.  </p>

<p>My question is, does cherrypy have a built in handler to handle multipart/mixed and chunked encoding for POST?  Or will I need to override the cherrypy.tools.process_request_body and roll my own decoder?</p>

<p>It seems like the builtin wsgi server with cherrypy handles this as part of the HTTP/1.1 spec, but I could not seem to find documentation in cherrypy in accessing this functionality.</p>

<hr>

<p>...to clarify</p>

<p>I'm using latest version 3.1.1 or so of Cherrypy.</p>

<p>Making a default form just involves making parameters in the upload function.</p>

<p>For the multipart/form-data, I've been calling curl -F param1=@file1.jpg -F param2=sometext -F param3=@file3.wav <a href=""http://destination:port/upload"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://destination:port/upload</a></p>

<p>In that example, I get:</p>

<pre><code>args = ['param1','param2','param3] 
kwargs = {'param1':CString&lt;&gt;, 'param2': 'sometext', 'param3':CString&lt;&gt;}
</code></pre>

<p>When trying to submit the multipart/mixed, I tried looking at the request.body, but kept on getting None for that, regardless of setting the body processing.</p>

<p>The input we're getting is coming in as this:</p>

<pre><code>user-agent:UNTRUSTED/1.0 Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1
content-language:en-US
content-length:565719
mime-version:1.0
content-type:multipart/mixed; boundary='newdivider'
host:192.168.1.1:8180

--newdivider
Content-type: image/jpeg
Content-ID: file://localhost/root1/photos/Garden.jpg
Content-transfer-encoding: binary

&lt;binary data&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've got a sneaking suspicion that the multipart/mixed is the problem that cherrypy is just giving me just the rfile. Our goal is to have cherrypy process the body into its parts with minimal processing on the receive side (ie, let cherrypy do its magic). If that requires us being tougher on the sending format to be a content-type that cherrypy likes, then so be it. What are the accepted formats? Is it only multipart/form-data?</p>

<p>Now, there is a tricky bit: If I have multiple files, I need to have one continous stream, which means that if the last piece of a file is smaller that pieceLength, then I need to read (pieceLength-got) of the next file, and then keep on going on until the end of the last file.</p>

"52702","1","","","2008-09-09 19:32:41","","2","5048","<p>I am looking to stream a file housed in a SharePoint 2003 document library down to the browser.  Basically the idea is to open the file as a stream and then to ""write"" the file stream to the reponse, specifying the content type and content disposition headers.  Content disposition is used to preserve the file name, content type of course to clue the browser about what app to open to view the file.  </p>

<p>This works all good and fine in a development environment and UAT environment.  However, in the production environment, things do not always work as expected,however only with IE6/IE7. FF works great in all environments. </p>

<p>Note that in the production environment SSL is enabled and generally used.  (When SSL is not used in the production environment, file streams, is named as expected, and properly dislays.)</p>

<p>Here is a code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>System.IO.FileStream fs = new System.IO.FileStream(Server.MapPath(""."") + ""\\"" + ""test.doc"", System.IO.FileMode.Open);
long byteNum = fs.Length;
byte[] pdfBytes = new byte[byteNum];
fs.Read(pdfBytes, 0, (int)byteNum);

Response.AppendHeader(""Content-disposition"", ""filename=Testme.doc"");
Response.CacheControl = ""no-cache"";
Response.ContentType = ""application/msword; charset=utf-8"";
Response.Expires = -1;
Response.OutputStream.Write(pdfBytes, 0, pdfBytes.Length);
Response.Flush();
Response.Close();
fs.Close();
</code></pre>

<p>Like I said, this code snippet works fine on the dev machine and in the UAT environment.  A dialog box opens and asks to save, view or cancel Testme.doc.  But in production onnly when using SSL, IE 6 &amp; IE7 don't use the name of the attachment.  Instead it uses the name of the page that is sending the stream, testheader.apx and then an error is thrown.  </p>

<p>IE does provide an advanced setting ""Do not save encrypted pages to disk"".  </p>

<p>I suspect this is part of the problem, the server tells the browser not to cache the file, while IE has the ""Do not save encrypted pages to disk"" enabled.</p>

<p>Yes I am aware that for larger files, the code snippet above will be a major drag on memory and this implimentation will be problematic. So the real final solution will not open the entire file into a single byte array, but rather will open the file as a stream, and then send the file down to the client in bite size chunks (e.g. perhaps roughly 10K in size).</p>

<p>Anyone else have similar experience ""streaming"" binary files over ssl?  Any suggestions or recommendations?</p>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>I think I see the problem, in C++ it can't really be done. The work around as pointed out by Budric is to use a single dimensional array but use all 3 dimensions multiplied to represent what would be the indexes:</p>

<pre><code>GLbyte *array = new GLbyte[xMax * yMax * zMax];
</code></pre>

<p>And to access, for example x/y/z of 1/2/3, you'd need to do:</p>

<pre><code>GLbyte byte = array[1 * 2 * 3];
</code></pre>

<p>However, the problem is, I don't think the <code>glTexImage2D</code> function supports this. Can anyone think of a workaround that would work with this OpenGL function?</p>

<h3>Edit 2:</h3>

<p>Attention OpenGL developers, this can be overcome by using a single dimensional array of pixels...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[0]: column 0 > [1]: row 0 > [2]: channel 0 ... n > [n]: row 1 ... n > [n]: column 1 .. n</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... no need to use a 3 dimensional array. In this case I've had to use this work around as 3 dimensional arrays are apparently not strictly possible in C++.</p>

<p>I have been struggling hard to debug and single-step through the NUnit tests.  I found some references online that suggested calling the following:</p>

<pre><code>NUnit.ConsoleRunner.Runner.Main(args);

<p>But this doesn't even compile - it has the compiler error:</p>

<p>I've added every assembly reference I could find, to no effect.</p>

<p>Finally, this is what I have hacked together and it works, but perhaps you good readers could suggest a better solution:</p>

<p>1) In my test project, the class name of a test case that I want to debug is MyTestClass.  It has a [TestFixtureSetUp] method named Init() and the actual test case is in [Test] function MyTest()</p>

<p>2) In my code project, I have a console program TestProgram.cs which compiles to an EXE.</p>

<p>In TestProgram.cs, I call the test cases in the following way</p>

<pre><code>// First instantiate the test class
MyTestClass tc = new MyTestClass();

// Call the TestFixtureSetup method
tc.Init();

// Now call the actual test
tc.MyTest();

<p>This works and I can debug and single step through the test cases.</p>

"634926","1","635000","","2009-03-11 15:01:08","","2","5060","<p><b>Background:</b> I'm using the SlimDX C# wrapper for DirectX, and am drawing many 2D sprites using the Sprite class (traditionally from the Direct3DX extension in the underlying dlls).  I'm drawing multiple hundreds of sprites to the screen at once, and the performance is awesome -- on my quad core, it's using something like 3-6% of the processor for my entire game, including logic for 10,000+ objects, ai routines on a second thread, etc, etc.  So clearly the sprites are being drawing using full hardware acceleration, and everything is as it should be.</p>

<p><b>Issue:</b> The problem comes when I start introducing calls to the Line class.  As soon as I draw 4 lines (for a drag selection box), processor usage skyrockets to 13-19%.  This is with only four lines!</p>

<p><b>Things I have tried:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Turning line antialiasing off and on.</li>
<li>Turning GLLines off and on.</li>
<li>Manually calling the line.begin and line.end around my calls to draw.</li>
<li>Omitting all calls to line.begin and line.end.</li>
<li>Ensuring that my calls to line.draw are not inside a sprite.begin / sprite.end block.</li>
<li>Calling line.draw inside a sprite.begin / sprite.end block.</li>
<li>Rendering 4 lines, or rendering 300.</li>
<li>Turning off all sprite and text rendering, and just leaving the line rendering for 4 lines (to see if this was some sort of mode-changing issue).</li>
<li>Most combinations of the above.</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, none of these had a significant impact on performance.  #3 reduced processor usage by maybe 2%, but even then it's still 8% or more higher than it should be.  The strangest thing is that #7 from above had absolutely zero impact on performance -- it was just as slow with 4 lines as it was with 300.  The only thing that I can figure is that this is being run in software for some reason, and/or that it is causing the graphics card to continually switch back and forth between some sort of drawing modes.</p>

<p><b>Matrix Approach:</b></p>

<p>If anyone knows of any fix to the above issue, then I'd love to hear it! </p>

<p>But I'm under the assumption that this might just be an issue inside of directx in general, so I've been pursuing another route -- making my own sprite-based line.  Essentially, I've got a 1px white image, and I'm using the diffuse color and transforms to draw the lines.  This works, performance-wise -- drawing 300 of the ""lines"" like this puts me in the 3-6% processor utilization performance range that I'm looking for on my quad core.</p>

<p>I have two problems with my pixel-stretch line technique, which I'm hoping that someone more knowledgeable about transforms can help me with.  Here's my current code for a horizontal line:</p>

<pre><code>    public void DrawLineHorizontal( int X1, int X2, int Y, float HalfHeight, Color Color )
    {
        float width = ( X2 - X1 ) / 2.0f;
        Matrix m = Matrix.Transformation2D( new Vector2( X1 + width, Y ), 0f, new Vector2( width, HalfHeight ),
            Vector2.Zero, 0, Vector2.Zero );
        sprite.Transform = m;

        sprite.Draw( this.tx, Vector3.Zero, new Vector3( X1 + width, Y, 0 ), Color );
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This works, insofar as it draws lines of mostly the right size at mostly the right location on the screen.  However, things appear shifted to the right, which is strange.  I'm not quite sure if my matrix approach is right at all: I just want to scale a 1x1 sprite by some amount of pixels horizontally, and a different amount vertically.  Then I need to be able to position them -- by the center point is fine, and I think that's what I'll have to do, but if I could position it by upper-left that would be even better.  This seems like a simple problem, but my knowledge of matrices is pretty weak.</p>

<p>This would get purely-horizontal and purely-vertical lines working for me, which is most of the battle.  I could live with just that, and use some other sort of graphic in locations which I am currently using angled lines.  But it would be really nice if there was a way for me to draw lines that are angled using this stretched-pixel approach.  In other words, draw a line from 1,1 to 7,19, for instance.  With matrix rotation, etc, it seems like this is feasible, but I don't know where to even begin other than guessing and checking, which would take forever.</p>

<p>Any and all help is much appreciated!</p>

<p>All this being said, something is just not clicking with me.  I haven't had that a-ha moment with either C# or OOP that gives me the ability to sit down, open up VS2008, and start coding.  I have to study other people's code so much that it simply seems like I'm not doing anything on my own.  I'm getting discouraged.</p>

<p>It's not like I'm not capable of it.  I picked up t-sql really quickly.  Someone can tell me what information they want out of the database and I can code out the tsql in a matter of a few minutes to give them what they want.  SQL is something that I get.  This isn't happening for me with OOP or C#.  Granted, C# is inherently more complex, but at some point it has to click.  Right?</p>

<p>I read over stackoverflow and I'm overwhelmed at how infinitely smart you all are.</p>

<p>What was it for you that made it click?</p>

A lot of the answers here were outstanding.  However, one in particular seemed to have risen to the top and that's the one I marked as the ""answer"".  I also hate not marking my questions with the answer.</p>

The application will always be full screen so I have to design my UI so that the monitor resolution will not impair the use of the application. I've been spending a good amount of time playing around with WPF trying to accomplish this. Today I found out about the Viewbox. It seems to solve all my problems. All I have to do is place the Grids used to layout each screen in Viewboxes and like magic I have a resolution independent application. </p>

<p>However, this just seems to easy. It doesn't feel right. Should I be using Viewboxes? If not what should I do instead? Before I found out about the Viewbox I was having difficulty coming up with a way to scale the font sizes with respect to resolution. With a Viewbox I don't have to worry about this. So if a Viewbox is the wrong thing to use, how do I go about resizing my text?</p>

"557922","1","557960","","2009-02-17 17:42:12","","1","5062","<p>Each product in my database can have at least three and sometimes four or five different prices, and which one is displayed is based on several factors.  How should I attempt to tackle this scenario?</p>

<p>Each product can have the following prices:</p>

<ul>
<li>List Price (MSRP)</li>
<li>Cost (what we pay for it)</li>
<li>Retail Price - shown on ""main"" site</li>
<li>Government price (our primary customer is the U.S. Government) - only shown on our government subdmain</li>
<li>Sale Price (valid for 1 month, but extended every month) - only shown on our government subdomain</li>
<li>BPA Price (special price for BPAs) - not shown but loaded onto government sites</li>
</ul>

<p>The list price is provided in the vendor's quarterly data file and kept in the <code>Products</code> table, since it's a finite part of a product entity.  How should I handle the other prices though?  </p>

<p>I'm thinking the best (only?) course of action is to have a separate table with the different price structure as well as <code>SaleStartDate</code> and <code>SaleEndDate</code> columns that I can check to see whether or not to display the sale price.  In fact, I'm not sure of any other way to handle this.</p>

<p>Also, I will need to have a duplicate of this (different prices, but same cost) as our company does the processing (all the work, really) for a different company that's in the same business as us; the products are identical but customers/orders/specific prices are different.  The current implementation has a duplicate database with everything repeated (same with the code) and I want to avoid this like the plague so I'm trying to come up with a way to abstract the common things out.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT (2/17/2009 @ 12:57PM):</strong> Except for the list price, the prices are all calculated based off the cost, however it's not always that easy; sometimes items need to have their prices manually changed independently of the margin, however this is handled manually via Excel and only once per quarter (3 months); when the data is loaded into the database the price is finite and isn't changed until the following quarter; the ""sale"" price is on perpetually forever, but it expires (not on our site, but on several government sites like GSA Advantage) and needs to be extended; it doesn't change though when it's extended.  The sale price is just to have our own site in sync with GSA Advantage, so if a government customer visits our site they'll see identical pricing as they would on Advantage.</p>

<p>RE: The other company, that might be a way to go, although it would be insanely annoying to have to do everything multiple times; the products are exactly the same, the cost is exactly the same (we basically do everything for them, it's another company in name only and the fact they have different customers than we do), but their prices use a different markup than ours.  Everything else is identical, which is why I was hoping to keep stuff like the product information in one table, and then keep the differences in separate tables.  The current system is a mess largely because <strong>everything</strong> (database, code files, images, everything) is duplicated, so refactoring the code in our website requires an identical change made to the other website.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT (2/17/2009 @ 4:52PM):</strong> Some very good ideas so far.  One of the issues is that, apart from reporting purposes and reference, only one of the price columns is ever the ""real"" one.  For example, the government price is <em>always</em> shown to government customers, but the sale price is shown instead if the current date falls during the sale date (""sale"" pricing is specific to government customers).  If the customer is ordering for a BPA (this will be determined by our order processing system and/or manual override by a user), the price is automatically the BPA price.  The list price might be shown to display the discount you are getting, and it's required for reports, but nothing else.</p>

<p>Also, I'm unsure of how badly normalizing things will make updates.  Right now, I'm just handed a spreadsheet with new pricing and told to update the database (since they're all in the products table); I do this based on the product's SKU since the ID is internal only and all of the related tables are linked via the SKU.  With a separate price table it becomes even more unwieldy, although I could still use the SKU as the reference (it's going to be a unique index for a product) but a lot more would have to be done manually.</p>

One of the pieces is something that polls the contents of a directory periodically, and, if there are any new things, paints them on the screen.  I've done this by having the UI form launch a polling thread with a pointer back to itself, and when the polling thread finds something it calls back to the form and calls a syncrhonized method to update it's display.  This seems to work fine.</p>

<p>The question I have is this.  In C#/.NET I know it is not nice to have non-UI threads updating the UI, and the correct way to handle this is to delegate it up to the UI thread.  </p>

<p>E.g. the following:</p>

<pre><code>public void DoSomeUIThing()

For example, one common rule of thumb is that every table should have a primary key and that the key should be <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key"" rel=""noreferrer"">devoid of information content</a>.  So I was wondering if anyone had written a book or published papers regarding design patterns for designing relational databases?</p>

<hr>

<p>@Gaius,</p>

<p>That is the question that a database designer needs to weigh--what is the probable stability of the database structure?  Given a long-enough horizon nothing is stable. Or to say the converse, given a long-enough horizon, everything is subject to change.  A surrogate key (in theory) should never change its meaning because it never had meaning to begin with.  </p>

<p>I guess the other thing to consider in that particular design scenario is who is it that will be seeing the primary key?  If the primary key is something that end-users will actually need to refer to then it makes sense to make it something they can understand.  But I can't think of many cases where an end-user needs to see a primary key; usually the primary key is present to allow the DB engine to speed up certain operations.</p>

<p>My original thought in asking the question was to find design patterns for database design that were codified by more experienced database designers than myself so as to, hopefully, avoid some easily avoidable errors.  It would be interesting reading if anyone had ever codified database design anti-patterns. </p>

<p>The one I'm working on now is I'm given an arbitrary number of undirected graph nodes, their neighbors and the distances for the edges connecting the nodes.  What I NEED is the distance between the two farthest nodes from eachother (the weight distance, not by # of nodes away).</p>

<p>Now, I do have Dijkstra's algorithm in the form of:</p>

<pre><code>// Dijkstra's Single-Source Algorithm
private int cheapest(double[] distances, boolean[] visited)
{
        int best = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; size(); i++)
        {
                if (!visited[i] &amp;&amp; ((best &lt; 0) || (distances[i] &lt; distances[best])))
                {
                        best = i;
                }
        }
        return best;
}

// Dijkstra's Continued
public double[] distancesFrom(int source)
{
        double[] result = new double[size()];
        java.util.Arrays.fill(result, Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY);
        result[source] = 0; // zero distance from itself
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[size()];
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; size(); i++)
        {
                int node = cheapest(result, visited);
                visited[node] = true;
                for (int j = 0; j &lt; size(); j++)
                {
                        result[j] = Math.min(result[j], result[node] + getCost(node, j));
                }

        }
        return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With this implementation I can give it a particular node and it will give me a list of all the distances from that node.  So, I could grab the largest distance in that list of distances but I can't be sure that any particular node is one of the two furthest ones at either end.  </p>

<p>So the only solution I can think of is to run this Dijkstra's algorithm on every node, go through each returned list of distances and looking for the largest distance.  After exhausting each node returning it's list of distances I should have the value of the largest distance between any two nodes (the ""road"" distance between the two most widely seperated villages).  There has got to be an easier way to do this because this seems really computationally expensive.  The problem says that there could be sample inputs with up to 500 nodes so I wouldn't want it to take prohibitively long. Is this how I should do it?</p>

<p>Here is a sample input for the problem:</p>

<p>Total Nodes: 5  </p>

<p>Edges:<br>
Nodes 2 - Connect - Node 4.  Distance/Weight 25<br>
Nodes 2 - Connect - Node 5.  Distance/Weight 26<br>
Nodes 3 - Connect - Node 4.  Distance/Weight 16<br>
Nodes 1 - Connect - Node 4.  Distance/Weight 14  </p>

<p>The answer to this sample input is ""67 miles"".  Which is the length of the road between the two most widely separated villages.</p>

<p>So should I do it how I described or is there a much simpler and much less computationally expensive way?</p>

<p>In my opinion, writing this:</p>

<pre><code>int* p = new int;

<p>should be equivalent to allocating an array of 1 element:</p>

<pre><code>int* p = new int[1];

<p>If this was true, the ""delete"" operator could always be deleting arrays, and we wouldn't need the ""delete[]"" operator.</p>

<p>Is there any reason why the ""delete[]"" operator was introduced in C++?  The only reason I can think of is that allocating arrays has a small memory footprint (you have to store the array size somewhere), so that distinguishing ""delete"" vs ""delete[]"" was a small memory optimization.</p>

<p>I started by storing the names of all modules in sys.modules that the python interpreter started with and then deleting all new modules from sys.modules when requested.

public class TOrder implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 2235742302377173533L;

    @Column(name = ""activationDate"")

    public Integer getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Integer id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public Calendar getActivationDate() {
        return activationDate;
    }

    public void setActivationDate(Calendar activationDate) {
        this.activationDate = activationDate;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This entity is mapped to Oracle 10g, so in the DB there will be a table T_ORDER with a primary key NUMBER column ""ID"" and a TIMESTAMP column ""activationDate"".</p>

<p>Lets suppose I create an instance of this class with the activation date ""15. Sep 2008 00:00AM"". My local timezone is CEST which is GMT+02:00. When I persist this object and select the data from the table T_ORDER using sqlplus, I find out that in the table actually ""14. Sep 2008 22:00"" is stored, which is ok so far, because the oracle db timezone is GMT.</p>

<p>But now the annoying part. When I read this entity back into my JAVA program, I find out that the oracle time zone is ignored and I get ""14. Sep 2008 22:00 CEST"", which is definitly wrong. </p>

<p>So basically, when writing to the DB the timezone information will be used, when reading it will be ignored.</p>

<p>Is there any solution for this out there? The most simple solution I guess would be to set the oracle dbs timezone to GMT+02, but unfortunatly I can't do this because there are other applications using the same server.</p>

Say that I have a view which can accept drag and drop, but only in certain areas. Once the user drags over one of these areas I call <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(this)</code> (from a <code>DragEvent.DRAG_OVER</code> handler), but if the user then moves out of this area I'd like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the <code>DragManager.NONE</code> feedback. However, neither calling <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(null)</code> nor <code>DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.NONE)</code> seems to have any effect. Once I've accepted the drag an set the feedback type I can't seem to change it.</p>

<p>Just to make it clear: the areas where the user should be able to drop are not components or even display objects, in fact they are just ranges in the text of a text field (like the selection). Had they been components of their own I could have solved it by making each of them accept drag events individually. I guess I could create proxy components that float over the text to emulate it, but I'd rather not if it isn't necessary.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've managed to get it working in both AIR and the browser now, but only by putting proxy components on top of the ranges of text where you should be able to drop things. That way I get the right feedback and drops are automatically unaccepted on drag exit.</p>

<p>This is the oddest thing about D&amp;D in AIR:</p>

<pre><code>DragManager.doDrag(initiator, source, event, dragImage, offsetX, offsetY);

<p>In browser-based Flex, <code>offsetX</code> and <code>offsetY</code> should be negative (so says the documentation, and it works fine). However, when running <em>exactly the same code</em> in AIR you have to make the offsets positive. The same numbers, but positive. That is very, very weird.</p>

It seems like drag and drop in AIR is different. It's really, really weird because not only is the feedback not showing correctly, and it's not possible to unaccept, but the coordinates are also completely off. I just tried my application in a browser instead of AIR and dragging and dropping is completely broken.</p>

<p>The application that will be using this service is an iPhone application, so I was thinking we could have a public key embedded in the application which we can do an additional signature with, but does this mean we'll have to have two signatures, one for the user key and one for the app key?</p>

<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I'd quite like to get this right the first time.</p>

Sometimes when we execute multiple searches successively the 2nd or 3rd search will sometimes return results from the first set of search criteria.  </p>

<p>Example: our first search we do a look up on ""John Smith"" -> John Smith results are displayed.  The second search we do a look up on ""Bob Jones"" -> John Smith results are displayed.  </p>

<p>We save all of the search criteria in session state as I said, and read it from session state inside of the ajax request to format the DB query.  When we put break points in VS everything behaves as normal, but without them we get the original search criteria and results.</p>

<p>My guess is because they are saved in session, that the ajax request somehow gets its own session and saves the criteria to that, and then retrieves the criteria from that session every time, but the non-async stuff is able to see when the criteria is modified and saves the changes to state accordingly, but because they are from two different sessions there is a disparity in what is saved and read.</p>

<p>EDIT:::
To elaborate more, there was a suggestion of appending the search criteria to the query string which normally is good practice and I agree thats how it should be but following our requirements I don't see it as being viable.  They want it so the user fills out the input controls hits search and there is no page reload, the only thing they see is a progress indicator on the page, and they still have the ability to navigate and use other features on the current page.  If I were to add criteria to the query string I would have to do another request causing the whole page to load, which depending on the search criteria can take a really long time.  This is why we are using an ajax call to perform the search and why we aren't causing another full page request.....  I hope this clarifies the situation.</p>

I know that you can do a dump but I don't believe you can tell it to isolate a single sub directory in the repo. If I export i'll only get the head or a single revision, this is not what I need. Is there anyway to achieve this, or is this just not supported?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>What I need is all the revision history and the changes to every file.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>It looks like rmeador's solution worked with one caveat. I was getting a cryptic error about a revision or file doesn't exist when executing the load command into a blank repo. svnadmin load seemed to get confused because  creation of the ""trunk"" directory got filtered out by svndumpfilter. Therefore creating ""trunk/MySubDirecory"" fails. Doing a svn add/commit manually for ""trunk"" on the target empty repo and then doing a ""svnadmin load"" solved this problem. </p>

<p>I get the data for 0 to 25 mph. But I do not know where to draw a data point. I do want to reproduce the R plot exactly.</p>

<p><strong>Here I have a data point every 1 mph.</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gb4gO.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Here I do not have a data pint every 1 mph. I only have a data point if there is data available.</strong></p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<pre><code># Plotting the a built in sample data
plot(cars$speed)
# Assingning the data to a new variable name
myData = cars$speed
# Calculating the edcf
myResult = ecdf(myData)
myResult
# Plotting the ecdf
plot(myResult)
# Have a look on the probability for 0 to 25 mph
myResult(0:25)
# Have a look on the probability but just where there ara data points
myResult(unique(myData))
# Saving teh stuff to a directory
write.csv(cbind(unique(myData), myResult(unique(myData))), file=""D:/myResult.txt"")
</code></pre>

<p>The file <code>myResult.txt</code> looks like</p>

<pre><code>"""",""V1"",""V2""

What I would like to be able to do is then query over this with Linq to XML so that I can scrape out the bits I need.  I'm using the method described <a href=""http://vijay.screamingpens.com/archive/2008/05/26/linq-amp-lambda-part-3-html-agility-pack-to-linq.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> to parse the HtmlDocument into an XDocument, but when trying to query over this I'm not sure how to handle namespaces.  In one particular document the original HTML was actually poorly formatted XHTML with the following tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" xml:lang=""en""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When trying to query from this document it seems that the namespace attribute is preventing me from doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>var x = xDoc.Descendants(""div"");
// returns null
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently for those ""div"" tags only the LocalName is ""div"", but the proper tag name is the namespace plus ""div"".  I have tried to do some research on the issue of XML namespaces and it seems that I can bypass the namespace by querying this way:</p>

<pre><code>var x = 
    (from x in xDoc.Descendants()
     where x.Name.LocalName == ""div""
     select x);
// works
</code></pre>

<p>However, this seems like a rather hacky solution and does not properly address the namespace issue.  As I understand it a proper XML document can contain multiple namespaces and therefore the proper way to handle it should be to parse out the namespaces I'm querying under.  Has anyone else ever had to do this?  Am I just making it way to complicated?  I know that I could avoid all this by just sticking with HtmlDocument and querying with XPath, but I would rather stick to what I know (Linq) if possible and I would also prefer to know that I am not setting myself up for further namespace-related issues down the road.</p>

<p>What is the proper way to deal with namespaces in this situation?</p>

<pre><code>// Quick, and very dirty
System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes(filename, new byte[f.Length]);
</code></pre>

<p>It works, atleast until you download a file that is several hundred MB's, or potentially even GB's and you throw Windows into a thrashing frenzy if not totally wipe out the pagefile and kill your systems memory altogether. Oops.</p>

<p>So, with a little more enlightenment, I set out with the following algorithm.</p>

<pre><code>using (FileStream outFile = System.IO.File.Create(filename))
{
    // 4194304 = 4MB; loops from 1 block in so that we leave the loop one 
    // block short
    byte[] buff = new byte[4194304];
    for (int i = buff.Length; i &lt; f.Length; i += buff.Length)
    {
        outFile.Write(buff, 0, buff.Length);
    }
    outFile.Write(buff, 0, f.Length % buff.Length);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works, well even, and doesn't suffer the crippling memory problem of the last solution. It's still slow though, especially on older hardware since it writes out (potentially GB's worth of) data out to the disk.</p>

<p>The question is this: Is there a better way of accomplishing the same thing? Is there a way of telling Windows to create a file of x size and simply allocate the space on the filesystem rather than actually write out a tonne of data. I don't care about initialising the data in the file at all (the protocol I'm using - bittorrent - provides hashes for the files it sends, hence worst case  for random uninitialised data is I get a lucky coincidence and part of the file is correct).</p>

<p>I have finally gotten the page to layout as it should across all browsers (all major browsers; Chrome, Opera, Safari, Firefox) except IE 9 and likely its legacy versions. Currently the links stop showing in the 'nav' bar after the second link (which has drop downs). The links are all horizontal safe for the drop down, until it comes to the link third and on they all show below the 'nav' bar and as a vertical list. I am sure the problem requires a separate style sheet for IE but the question is a master style sheet or the menu style sheet, and to what end? </p>

/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the block elements. The elements within these blocks have padding on their sides. This saves you from any ""box model math"". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the block itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the block element and place a second block element within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a block set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For blocks where this rule must be broken, you should add a ""display:inline"" declaration to the block element's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar blocks could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the left instead of the right, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all left instead of all right) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the blocks around in the HTML source.

I've also had to work with some Japanese encoding that starts every character with a 0xE3 and is three bytes long.  It displays on my computer properly if I choose the Japanese locale in Windows, however, it doesn't display properly in our application.  However, if any other locale other than Japanese is selected, I cannot even view the filenames properly. So I'm guessing this encoding is not Unicode. Anyone know what it is? Is it ANSI? Is it Shift JIS?</p>

<p>For the Chinese one, I've tested it with Unicode and UTF-8 characters and I'm getting the same pattern; 0x7F followed by three bytes.  Are Unicode and UTF-8 the same? </p>

<p>I am attempting to include a second boxplot into an existing boxplot that is ordered by the mean of the values plotted.  When I include the boxplot from the second data.frame (representing a control sample to the other plots), the original plot looses its ordering.</p>

<p>Below is an example:</p>

<pre><code>x1 &lt;- data.frame(""V1"" = runif(100, 0, 100), ""siteno"" = ""X1"") #mean = 50.3

xData &lt;- rbind(x1,x2,x3)
xData$siteno &lt;- with(xData, reorder(siteno, V1, mean))

zData &lt;- data.frame(""V1"" = runif(300, 0, 450), ""siteno"" = ""Z1"") #mean = 224.2

#orders xData correctly 
ggplot(xData, aes(x = siteno , y = V1)) +
stat_summary(fun.y=mean, colour=""red"", geom=""point"") +
geom_boxplot (aes(fill=siteno), alpha=.5, width=1, position = position_dodge(width = 1),  outlier.colour = ""dark gray"", outlier.size = 1)

<p>If I try the code below to add the control data, the order of the x variables is lost:</p>

<pre><code>x1 &lt;- data.frame(""V1"" = runif(100, 0, 100), ""siteno"" = ""X1"") #mean = 50.3
x2 &lt;- data.frame(""V1"" = runif(100, 200, 450), ""siteno"" = ""X2"") #mean = 322.4
x3 &lt;- data.frame(""V1"" = runif(100, 50, 150), ""siteno"" = ""X3"") #mean = 97.8
xData &lt;- rbind(x1,x2,x3)
xData$siteno &lt;- with(xData, reorder(siteno, V1, mean))

zData &lt;- data.frame(""V1"" = runif(300, 0, 450), ""siteno"" = ""Z1"") #mean = 224.2

#orders xData correctly 
ggplot(xData, aes(x = siteno , y = V1)) +

geom_boxplot (aes(fill=siteno), alpha=.5, width=1, position = position_dodge(width = 1), outlier.colour = ""dark gray"", outlier.size = 1) +
geom_boxplot(data=zData, aes(x = siteno , y = V1))

<p>this produces the following plot with no ordering of the x variables:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zlL1w.jpg"" alt=""incorrectly ordered boxplots""> </p>

<p>The point of my graph is to show the test values ordered by their mean and then have the control values boxplot off to the right for visual reference. I imagine there could be a solution that combines the xData and zData dataframes; I am willing to try that if there are some suggestions.

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>As noted ""_HAS_EXCEPTIONS 0"" doesn't turn off exceptions, per se. What it does is, at least in the vector header file, is call _Raise on an exception object instead of calling the C++ ""throw"". In my case, it can't link to the exception object's _Raise function since I am not including the correct library. What that library is, though, is not obvious.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When users request a page, it can take anywhere from 200 to 500ms for the backend server to stitch together the HTML page. During this time, the browser is idle as it waits for the data to arrive. In PHP you have the function flush(). It allows you to send your partially ready HTML response to the browser so that the browser can start fetching components while your backend is busy with the rest of the HTML page. The benefit is mainly seen on busy backends or light frontends. </p>
  
  <p>A good place to consider flushing is right after the HEAD because the HTML for the head is usually easier to produce and it allows you to include any CSS and JavaScript files for the browser to start fetching in parallel while the backend is still processing. </p>
  
  <p>Example:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>... &lt;!-- css, js --&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;?php flush(); ?&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
... &lt;!-- content --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note the point at which the flush occurs here is after the head tag is written.  This makes a lot of sense so the browser can begin loading images and scripts while the remainder of the page is rendered and served.</p>

<p>Is there a way to flush after the head (or any other part of the page) explicitly using ASP.NET?</p>

I'd rather not use Flash though, so I though about using .NET.</p>

<p>Now I believe the correct terminology for a native code control that can be downloaded and run in the browser is ""ActiveX control"". So my question is, can I create such an ActiveX control with .NET?</p>

<p>I've found some tutorials on the web, but they all expect you to have the assembly installed on your local machine, and registered and trusted both it and the website that's accessing it.</p>

<p>This is asking a bit much for potential anonymous internet users, and even for intranet users another method of deployment would be preferable.</p>

<p>I distinctly remember some website asking me to download this or that ActiveX control. And on pages requiring such browser plugins as Flash and Java, there is some mechanism by which the browser knows where to fetch the plugin for that media type.</p>

<p>So my question is twofold:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I create a control that can run in the user's browser in .NET?</li>
<li>What is the best method of (semi-)automatic delivery that I can achieve?</li>

<p>Yes, a lot of JavaScript rich text editors allow you to paste a <strong>linked image</strong> into a text field, and it will insert the correct &lt;img&gt; tag. However, this only works for images that already have a location on the web, and I want this to upload new images just by copy/pasting any random bitmap from your clipboard.</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, of course, I want to perform the decoupling magic that I keep reading about and uncomment one of the modules and see its tab item not appear at all. Instead, on the contrary, there are still two TabItems and one is empty. This tells me that my application is still tightly coupling data and UI as in the bad old WinForm days.</p>

<p>So what do I need to do here to make this dynamic, so that the UI changes dynamically based on what modules are loaded, i.e. so that I could load 10 modules/views in my bootstrapper and there would automatically be 10 TabItems in the TabControl?</p>

<h2>INTERMEDIATE ANSWER:</h2>

<p>If I just make one region in a TabControl:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TabControl Name=""MainRegion"" cal:RegionManager.RegionName=""MainRegion""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and then load both controls into the MainRegion:</p>

<pre><code>        public void Initialize()
        {
            regionManager.RegisterViewWithRegion(""MainRegion"", typeof(Views.SecondView));
        }
...
        public void Initialize()
        {
            regionManager.RegisterViewWithRegion(""MainRegion"", typeof(Views.HelloWorldView));
        }
</code></pre>

<p>then I get a TabControl with two tabs, each with a view in it, which is what I want.</p>

<p>But the TabItem headers are not defined. How do I dynamically define the header (e.g. not in the XAML but dynamically back in the View classes)?</p>

<p>You are right, I found a java program called <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=129468"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Krut</a> that can record screen sessions, but it uses JPEGImageEncoder, the image quality isn't as good as I want, so I wonder if I can use ImageIO to encode the sequence.</p>

<p>If ImageIO can't do it, my next question would be is there a stand alone open source PNGImageEncoder that I can use to encode it? I know there are open source PNGImageEncoders, but they tend to be tangled in projects and hard to get all the supporting files out of it, any ideas? Thanks!</p>

<p>If you ever see these lines and are mistified like I was, here's what they mean.</p>

<p><code>Thread[AWT-EventQueue-0] (Suspended (exception NullPointerException))</code></p>

<p><code>EventDispatchTread.run() line: not available [local variables unavailable]</code></p>

<p>It's not that the variables are unavailable because they are lurking behind a shroud of mystery in a library somewhere dank. No no, they just went out of scope! It's still your fault, you still have to find the null, and no you can't blame the library. Important lesson!</p>

<h3>QUESTION:</h3>

<p>One of the most frustrating things for me, as a beginner is libraries! It's a love/hate relationship: On the one hand they let me do things I wouldn't normally understand how to do with the code that I do understand, on the other hand because I don't completely understand them, they sometimes throw a wrench in code that is otherwise working fine! It's because I don't understand the errors that can occur when using these libraries, because I didn't write them, and because eclipse doesn't give me a great deal to go with when one of imports starts acting up...</p>

<p>So here's the problem: I've been working with java.awt.event to handle a bunch of JButtons on the screen for this and that. I get an error when I use one of the buttons I've made. The error is:</p>

<p><code>Thread[AWT-EventQueue-0] (Suspended (exception NullPointerException))</code></p>

<p><code>EventDispatchTread.run() line: not available [local variables unavailable]</code></p>

<p>What does this mean? What could be causing it? I'm embarrassed to post code, but if you can stand to try to decipher my terrible style, here is the method that seems to cause this error to be thrown.</p>

<pre><code>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
    String cmd = e.getActionCommand();
    String name;

code...

if(cmd.equals(""Play"")) {
        name = field.getText();
        card = getCard(name);

        if(card != null) {
            if(rules.zoneHasCard(card, rules.hand)) {
                display.updateStatusMessage(rules.play(card));

                display.updateDiscard(rules.zoneList(""Discard"")); // This is the error here! The discard Zone was empty!
            }
            else {
                field.setText(""You do not have "" + card.getName());

Thanks a lot for the answers! Just thought I'd add a few points to the above:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have tried removing all obstacles surrounding my localhost; turned off the firewall and antivirus, stopped pouring milk into my computer case, killed any heavy processes etc.</li>
<li>This is not contained to just one project or app; it's something I've noticed and wondered about since I started working as a developer ( ~1 year )</li>
<li>Don't think inaccessible resources has any significance; when working locally I usually have all the project's assets(pictures, flash, etc.) locally</li>
<li>Can't really see any difference concering cache on or off.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chose a random page from the project I'm currently working on, reloaded it completly a couple of times; locally I got it in about 4 seconds, compared to ~2 sec from the server.
This was using FF and Firebug; using Opera I kind of felt there was a smaller difference but that's just my gut...</p>

We have various options to set transparencies of images, different fonts, colors, and just a bunch of stuff to make the cards look pretty.

For example, some edge to edge printing really doesn't seem to be edge to edge, while on other printers it seems to go over the edge.</p>

<p>What I think we need is a way to install various card printer drivers, print to them, and have the output go to an image or pdf or something that we can view on screen to see what it looks like when the driver prints to the printer.</p>

<p>However, I am not sure if that would really work or not. I am not a hardware person, so I don't know how the drivers really interact with the printer hardware. </p>

<p>We ordered yet another card printer (different manufacturer) to test on yet another printer... The problem is, we could be spending a whole lot of money every time a customer comes to us and says, ""ummm, our Joe's Hardware Card Printer isn't working quite right.""</p>

There are a tremendous number of moving parts recently: the app itself has changed significantly; the development toolchain was just updated; and both the local and remote equipment have been ""modified"" to support those changes.</p>

<p>The bright side is that it has a reasonable logging system that will write debug messages to a file, and it will log to both the file and a real-time user screen.  I have an opportunity to re-work the entire log/debug mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>All messages are time-stamped and prefixed with a severity level.</li>
<li>Logs are for the customer.  They record the system's responses to his/her requests.</li>
<li>Any log that identifies a problem also suggests a solution.</li>
<li>Debugs are for developers and Tech Support.  They reveal the system internals.</li>
<li>Debugs indicate the function and/or line that generated them.</li>
<li>The customer can adjust the debug level on the fly to set the verbosity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What best practices have you used as a developer, or seen as a consumer, that generate useful logs and debugs?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Many helpful suggestions so far, thanks!  To clarify: I'm more interested in <em>what</em> to log: content, format, <em>etc</em>.--and the reasons for doing so--than specific tools.</p>

It appears they're unlikely to pay for it, so our boss would like us to introduce a time bomb.</p>

<p><strong><em>[Edit:] Technical responses only please! Whether this is a good (or legal) idea is a question for CEOoverflow.com</em></strong> ;-)</p>

<p>All pages in the application inherit from a class called ApplicationBasePage and have consistent error handling, so I'm thinking that throwing an exception early in the lifecycle of ApplicationBasePage will be an easy way to make the application unusable. I'm open to other ideas you may have though.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>how and where should we store the date on which the application will expire?</strong></p>

<p>Some points to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>The application is installed on a single server in the customer's offices.</li>
<li>Application data is held in a SQL Server 2005 database held on the same server. The database was designed by us and is not used for anything else.</li>
<li>The application is only accessible on their intranet: there is no access to the application over the Internet.</li>
<li>We currently have remote desktop access to their server, but would expect to lose that if things turn nasty.</li>
<li>The application is written in .NET 2.0.</li>
<li>Security is handled by FormsAuthentication.</li>
<li>We need to be able to turn the timebomb off or change the its trigger date easily (assume we still have remote desktop access to do this).</li>
<li>The server can normally access the Internet, but it would be best not to rely on this.</li>
<li>The timebomb will only lock users out: it won't destroy any data.</li>
<li>Unless it triggers, the customer must never be aware of the time bomb's existence.</li>
<li>Their IT guy will happily go poking around in the web.config or in the database. He's not a programmer but he's not afraid to change things ""just to see what happens"". Decompiling or reverse engineering the application would be beyond his capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>For extra credit, how much do you think it's OK to rely on security through obscurity in this case?</p>

<p>[<strong>Edit:</strong>]</p>

<ul>
<li>The application does a lot of business-critical date-dependent stuff, so we can be sure they won't change the clock on their server as this would make the application worse than useless.</li>

"244772","1","244805","","2008-10-28 20:38:28","","16","5111","<p>I'm creating a series of builders to clean up the syntax which creates domain classes for my mocks as part of improving our overall unit tests.  My builders essentially populate a domain class (such as a <code>Schedule</code>) with some values determined by invoking the appropriate <code>WithXXX</code> and chaining them together.</p>

<p>I've encountered some commonality amongst my builders and I want to abstract that away into a base class to increase code reuse.  Unfortunately what I end up with looks like:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class BaseBuilder&lt;T,BLDR&gt; where BLDR : BaseBuilder&lt;T,BLDR&gt; 
                                          where T : new()
{
    public abstract T Build();

    protected int Id { get; private set; }
    protected abstract BLDR This { get; }

    public BLDR WithId(int id)
    {
        Id = id;
        return This;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Take special note of the <code>protected abstract BLDR This { get; }</code>.</p>

<p>A sample implementation of a domain class builder is:</p>

<pre><code>public class ScheduleIntervalBuilder :
    BaseBuilder&lt;ScheduleInterval,ScheduleIntervalBuilder&gt;
{
    private int _scheduleId;
    // ...

    // UG! here's the problem:
    protected override ScheduleIntervalBuilder This
    {
        get { return this; }
    }

    public override ScheduleInterval Build()
    {
        return new ScheduleInterval
        {
            Id = base.Id,
            ScheduleId = _scheduleId
                    // ...
        };
    }

    public ScheduleIntervalBuilder WithScheduleId(int scheduleId)
    {
        _scheduleId = scheduleId;
        return this;
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Because BLDR is not of type BaseBuilder I cannot use <code>return this</code> in the <code>WithId(int)</code> method of <code>BaseBuilder</code>.</p>

<p>Is exposing the child type with the property <code>abstract BLDR This { get; }</code> my only option here, or am I missing some syntax trick?</p>

<p>Update (since I can show why I'm doing this a bit more clearly):</p>

<p>The end result is to have builders that build profiled domain classes that one would expect to retrieve from the database in a [programmer] readable format.  There's nothing wrong with...</p>

<pre><code>mock.Expect(m =&gt; m.Select(It.IsAny&lt;int&gt;())).Returns(
    new Schedule
    {
        ScheduleId = 1
        // ...
    }
);
</code></pre>

<p>as that's pretty readable already.  The alternative builder syntax is:</p>

<pre><code>mock.Expect(m =&gt; m.Select(It.IsAny&lt;int&gt;())).Returns(
    new ScheduleBuilder()
        .WithId(1)
        // ...
        .Build()
);
</code></pre>

<p>the advantage I'm looking for out of using builders (and implementing all these <code>WithXXX</code> methods) is to abstract away complex property creation (automatically expand our database lookup values with the correct <code>Lookup.KnownValues</code> without hitting the database obviously) and having the builder provide commonly reusable test profiles for domain classes...</p>

<pre><code>mock.Expect(m =&gt; m.Select(It.IsAny&lt;int&gt;())).Returns(
    new ScheduleBuilder()
        .AsOneDay()
        .Build()
);

I've been told that the following issues with this setup currently exist: </p>

<ol>
<li>When using an UNC path as home directory, there is an ""index"" somewhere in IIS which ""caches"" up to a certain amount of files of certain types, and when the limit, which defaults to 50, has been reached, subsequent requests to pages not in the cache will return 404.</li>
<li>When using an UNC path as home directory, when starting the IIS site, the aforementioned ""cache"" will start filling, which will bog down the site IIS until the cache is filled, meaning that huge sites (15,000 .asp files) are unavailable for up to 30 minutes after the IIS site starts. </li>
<li>When using an UNC path as home directory, if more than a certain number of simultaneous requests are made to the site, Windows will reach the ""Network BIOS command limit per server"", and all requests above the limit will have to wait until IIS ""closes the session"" to the server. I am told the limit is 100 files and not configurable. </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, all this sounds a bit weird. If I set up a new Windows 2003 server with default settings, and use it to host an ASP Classic application with 15,000 .asp files, using a share on a server as the home directory for the IIS site, <strong>will I actually run into these problems? And if so, is there a way to counter them without changing the architecture?</strong></p>

<p>(To clarify, the only reason the ""load balancing"" is important is that load balancing is the reason the files are on a share on a server. If no load balancing was needed, the files could be on the local disk.) </p>

I'm thinking of returning a DataTable from BookDB to BookManager and having it create the Book Object and return it, but that doesn't seem right.
Is there another way to do this?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:
I decided to seperate each layer into a project and ran into a circular dependency problem in the DAL layer when trying to add a reference to the BLL.
I can't access the Book Class or Interface or anything in BLL from DAL.
Should i just use ado.net objects here and have my manager create the actual object from the ado.net object?

A Curried application of E is either an application of E or an application of a Curried application of E.""</p>

<p>(Edit: I corrected the above quote ... I'd originally misquoted the definition.)</p>

<p>The task is to define a Curried application of the procedure which evaluates to 3 for </p>

<p>I really don't understand the idea here, and reading the Wikipedia entry on Curriying didn't really help.</p>

<p>Can anyone help with a more lucid explanation of what's being asked for here?</p>

<p>Actually even giving me the answer to this problem would be helpful, since there are five more to solve after this one. ... I just am not getting the basic idea.</p>

<p>Addition: Even after Brian Campbell's lengthy explanation, I'm still somewhat lost.</p>

<p>Is <code>(foo1 (sqrt 3)))</code> considered an application of foo, and therefore a curried application of foo?</p>

<p>Seems too simple, but maybe...</p>

<p>Typing <code>(((foo1 2 )) 2)</code> into DrScheme gives the following error (which I kind of expected) </p>

<p>After re-reading <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36314/what-is-currying"">What is Currying?</a> I understand I can also re-define foo1 to be:</p>

<pre><code>(define (foo1 a)

<p>So then I can type </p>

<p>But this doesn't really get me any closer to producing 3 as an output, and it seems like this isn't really currying the original foo1, it's just re-defining it.</p>

<pre><code>// some js code working with the customAttribute value
javascriptElementObject.customAttribue = void(0);

<p>The javascriptElementObject is now a jQuery object and I have been attempting to use the following code to do the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>// some js code working with the customAttribute value
javascriptElementObject.attr(""customAttribute"", void(0));

<p>However, this does not seem to be doing anything. The following code works however:</p>

<pre><code>javascriptElementObject.get(0).customAttribute = void(0);

<p>I'm aware of jQuery's removeAttr() function, but have not used it so far because I don't know if it's equivalent to setting the attribute value to void(0).</p>

<p>So I guess that really means I have 2 questions: </p>

<li>Why doesn't the first jQuery version work? </li>

<p>The previous build, which was PDE-based, resulted in a separate headless application which parses through all plugins in the context, looks inside them for test classes, tosses all test cases into a larger suite, and then runs it programmatically, via <code>JUnitResultFormatter.startTestSuite()</code>.

You have to share the folder on the server. Then grant the Development Server (the PC itself) write permissions. This will make external backups possible with SQL server.

<li><strong>title</strong>: string value</li>
<li><strong>date</strong>: string value</li>

<li><strong>countAnswers</strong>: integer</li>
<li><strong>lastPost</strong>: integer, (This field = the ID of the last post which was replied to it. Only used when the parentPost-field = NULL)</li>

users

<li><strong>userid</strong>: integer, primary key</li>
<li><strong>firstName</strong>: string value</li>
<li><strong>lastName</strong>: string value</li>

<p>Returns all I need (ID, Title, Date, Author and how many replies it has), except for the date and author of the last posted reply.</p>

<p>In addition, I'd like to fetch the following:</p>

<p>The date from the last post in the thread, that is the post with the highest ID <em>and</em> parentPost = forumPosts.id. I'd also want to fetch the firstName and lastName from the user that posted this reply.</p>

<p>I've been fooling around now for a long time with different joins and derived tables and such, but I can't seem to get this right. Ideally, i'd want a table returned with the following fields:</p>

<li>lastName</li>
<li>countAnswers</li>
<li>lastReplyDate</li>

<p>Edit: Thanks so far. The Problem with ReSharper or ""Remove and Readd if build breaks"" is that it's quite tedious on every single file and assembly (My project has about 120 .cs Files in 7 Assemblies, and references a total of 18 Assemblies outside of the solution), so ideally i'm looking for something ""one-click"".

<p>Since there is only one version of the runtime that even knows what what a shared_ptr is, static linking is my only danger (for now...). I thought I've read that boost's version of a shared_ptr was safe to use like this, but I'm using Redmond's version...</p>

Whilst I will state that handling exceptions from an application-wide point of view isn't something we want, typically it's unavoidable when our team are understaffed for the sheer amount of work we need to push out the door, so please, no flaming the globalised solution to exception handling here :)</p>

<p>I've had a good hunt to see what common solutions exist.  At the moment we use Global.asax with the Application_Error event to do Server.GetLastError() which is placed in Session state then a redirect is called to another page where the session data is then retrieved and output in a human readable format.  The redirect also calls a sproc which will carefully audit the error information which is a) e-mailed to the developers and b) viewed from a web page only viewable by developers.</p>

<p>The new way I've seen of doing things is using the IHttpModule interface using a class in App_Code to do something along these lines (this is my quick implementation)</p>

<pre><code>Imports Microsoft.VisualBasic

Public Class ErrorModule : Implements IHttpModule

  Public Sub Dispose() Implements System.Web.IHttpModule.Dispose
    ' Not used
  End Sub

  Public Sub Init(ByVal context As System.Web.HttpApplication) Implements System.Web.IHttpModule.Init
    AddHandler context.Error, AddressOf context_Error
  End Sub

  Public Sub context_Error(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Dim ex As Exception = HttpContext.Current.Server.GetLastError

    ' do something with the error
    ' call the stored procedure
    ' redirect the user to the error page

    HttpContext.Current.Server.ClearError()
    HttpContext.Current.Response.Redirect(""index.htm"")

  End Sub
End Class
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, what is the benefit of this solution over using Global.asax events?  Additionally, what is the best way to hand the data to an error page?</p>

<p><em>EDIT:</em> The code above does work by the way ;)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Also, how does the HttpModule work behind the scenes?  Does it just register the Error event to that particular function on application start?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Upon much further investigation it seems grabbing session data is really, really messy when it comes to using IHttpModule interface.  I don't think MS have matured HttpModule enough for it to be used in our particular scenario - until there are events specific to session data it's too dangerous for us to use.</p>

<p>Secondly I'd like a command that reverted (without query) all my open buffers that have no unsaved changes, and queried me about those that do have unsaved changes.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I'd be open to suggestions about other solutions, ways of working, etc I could try.  I'm fairly happy writing emacs-lisp if people can give me pointers on where to start.</p>

<p>PS I'm using Aquamacs on OSX if that matters.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Well, I've found the revbuffs package to be pretty much what I need.  Certainly enough to stop me wanting to try and write anything new myself.  (I mapped revbuffs to Cmd-R which works quite nicely. Kind of similar to Cmd-R in other Mac apps).</p>

<p>Global-auto-revert mode would have been a perfectly fine solution, and I wish I could choose two answers.  I prefer revbuffs simply because of a, possibly irrational, feeling of wanting to be in control of what happens.</p>

<p>I'd kind of guessed that if I accessed git from within emacs, then it could probably be handled easier, but I currently prefer accessing git through the commandline.  (I haven't quite been using emacs long enough to make it my operating system).  I will investigate magit a little more thoroughly though.</p>

<p>Edit2:</p>

<p>I've been using magit for a year now and can highly recommend it for dealing with git from within emacs.  However I still use revbuffs whenever I do a rebase outside of emacs.</p>

I'm trying (for now) to write a very simple server program that accepts a socket connection and starts a new thread to process it. It seems to work fine except that it will only create about 300 threads (303, sometimes 304) before pthread_create() fails with the EAGAIN code, which means:</p>

<p>""The  system  lacked  the  necessary  resources to create another thread, or the system-imposed  limit  on  the  total  number  of threads in a process {PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX} would be exceeded.""</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> 303 threads at the same time - each thread exits which is confirmed by gdb. Each time the process request function is called there are two threads running.</p>

<p>So it means ""the system lacked the necessary resources"". My question is (and it may be a bit stupid) - what are these resources? Presumably it's a memory leak in my program (certainly possible, likely even), but I'd have thought that even so it could manage more than 300 considering the rest of the program does very little.</p>

<p>How can I find out how much memory my program has available to confirm that it's running out of it? There's plenty of memory and swap free so presumably there's an artificial limit imposed by the OS (Linux).</p>

"417774","1","","","2009-01-06 19:25:16","","11","5159","<p>I've been struggling for some time now with exactly how to recode a page-based PHP application using an MVC framework. Just for background, I am having to move the app into MVC because my boss is making me. Anyway, I've sat down, and printed out the directory structure. I've then started trying to plan how I can convert these pages into controller/action pairs. Some things seem very straight forward. For example, I had a couple pages devoted to add/edit/delete of a user. That's very easy to create a ""user"" controller, and add methods or actions for add/edit/delete. Where I am having problems is deciding when to actually create a controller versus making something just an action as it's not always so clear cut. For example, a login controller versus user/login, or a register controller versus user/register. To me, if the object can do something it makes perfect sense to be an action, but it's just not always so clear cut.</p>

<p>Another example would be, that I have about 12 form pages that are used to create a ""plan"". In my head I would think I needed to create a ""plan"" controller, and each one of the old for pages would then become an action. So I'd have one controller with 12 actions (methods). The problem for me is, that although all 12 of these pages are data entry forms that eventually make up this ""plan"" that's all they have in common. Each of the pages use different tables in the database, and have nothing else in common with each other. Basically by creating a ""plan"" controller I'm just really using that as a grouping mechanism; not necessarily using it because they have something related with each other. At least in the ""user"" controller example above; each one of those actions uses the same ""user"" table, so it makes sense to group those actions into one controller. Should I make each one of those data entry forms there own controller?</p>

<p>I guess it just boils down to letting myself use controllers as a hierarchy structure entity instead of objects/actions. It just seems it's really easy to fall into that trap using controllers the wrong way. Does anyone understand what I'm saying? Hopefully it's not too confusing.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: If I try and stick with one controller per view; I will then be keeping code per request to a minimum. Is this the best way?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: From what everyone is saying, it seems that the one controller per view would not be in my best interest. I still have some concerns because it seems that a controller could become fat in a hurry, but that's for another discussion. I also still have some issues of when to make that decision to use a controller instead of an action. A good example would be stack<strong>overflow</strong> itself.  At the top of the page, you have a ""Questions"" selection which we could assume takes you to the ""questions"" controller. I say this because on the right hand side you can choose to ""Ask a question"", which the URL points to ""questions/ask"". That makes sense that your using the ask method of the questions controller. What confuses me is then you have the ""Unanswered"" option on the menu. It looks like this has a controller to itself. Why wouldn't it just be an action under the questions controller as in ""questions/unanswered""? That's where things become muddy for me.</p>

Below is a minimal working example taken from this book:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wehrens R. Chemometrics with R multivariate data analysis in the
  natural sciences and life sciences. 1st edition. Heidelberg; New York:
  Springer. 2011. (page 250).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The example was taken from this book and its package <code>ChemometricsWithR</code>. It highlighted some pitfalls when modeling using cross-validation techniques.  </p>

<p><strong>The Aim:</strong><br>
A cross-validated methodology using the same set of repeated CV to perform a known strategy of <code>PLS</code> followed typically by <code>LDA</code> or cousins like logistic regression, SVM, C5.0, CART, with the spirit of <code>caret</code> package. So PLS would be needed every time before calling the waiting classifier in order to classify PLS <em>score</em> space instead of the observations themselves. The nearest approach in the caret package is doing <code>PCA</code> as a pre-processing step before modeling with any classifier. Below is a PLS-LDA procedure with only one cross-validation to test performance of the classifier, there was no 10-fold CV or any repetition. The code below was taken from the mentioned book but with some corrections otherwise throws error:   </p>

<pre><code>library(ChemometricsWithR)
data(prostate)
prostate.clmat &lt;- classvec2classmat(prostate.type) # convert Y to a dummy var

odd &lt;- seq(1, length(prostate.type), by = 2) # training
even &lt;- seq(2, length(prostate.type), by = 2) # holdout test

prostate.pls &lt;- plsr(prostate.clmat ~ prostate, ncomp = 16, validation = ""CV"", subset=odd)

Xtst &lt;- scale(prostate[even,], center = colMeans(prostate[odd,]), scale = apply(prostate[odd,],2,sd))

tst.scores &lt;- Xtst %*% prostate.pls$projection # scores for the waiting trained LDA to test

prostate.ldapls &lt;- lda(scores(prostate.pls)[,1:16],prostate.type[odd]) # LDA for scores
table(predict(prostate.ldapls, new = tst.scores[,1:16])$class, prostate.type[even])

predictionTest &lt;- predict(prostate.ldapls, new = tst.scores[,1:16])$class)

library(caret)

<p>However, the confusion matrix didn't match that in the book, anyway the code in the book did break, but this one here worked with me!</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong><br>
Although this was only one CV, but the intention is to agree on this methodology first, <code>sd</code> and <code>mean</code> of the train set were applied on the test set, PLUS transformed into PLS scores based a specific number of PC <code>ncomp</code>. I want this to occur every round of the CV in the caret. If the methodology as code is correct here, then it can serve, may be, as a good start for a minimal work example while modifying the code of the caret package.</p>

<p><strong>Side Notes:</strong><br>
It can be very messy with scaling and centering, I think some of the PLS functions in R do scaling internally, with or without centering, I am not sure, so building a custom model in caret should be handled with care to avoid both lack or multiple scalings or centerings (I am on my guards with these things).  </p>

<p><strong>Perils of multiple centering/scaling</strong><br>
The code below is just to show how multliple centering/scaling can change the data, only centering is shown here but the same problem with scaling applies too.  </p>

<pre><code>set.seed(1)
x &lt;- rnorm(200, 2, 1)
xCentered1 &lt;- scale(x, center=TRUE, scale=FALSE)
xCentered2 &lt;- scale(xCentered1, center=TRUE, scale=FALSE)
xCentered3 &lt;- scale(xCentered2, center=TRUE, scale=FALSE)
sapply (list(xNotCentered= x, xCentered1 = xCentered1, xCentered2 = xCentered2, xCentered3 = xCentered3), mean)
</code></pre>

<p>Output:  </p>

<p>Edit</p>

<p>I really do not want to use transactions for most of this, as it is just for reporting purposes.  So an example of what I am doing is:</p>

<pre><code>/******************************************************************************

   current status of the loan.

UPDATE #table SET currWorker = tblUser.UserLogonName

  UPDATE #table SET currWorker = tblUser.UserLogonName

<p>I have a process that can take several minutes to complete, it is ran by a calling a HTTPHandler using a asynchronous javascript request.</p>

<p>Question 1: How can I ensure that this request does not time out on both the server and the client?</p>

<p>Question 2: Is it possible to emit data from the HTTPHandler while processing that is sent back to the XmlHttpRequest object before the final page is completed?</p>

<p>I'd like to calculate actual workload and return percentage done. I'm guessing that this is possible.</p>

<p>Any tips?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>A quick test:</p>

<pre><code>    public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context)
    {
        context.Response.ContentType = ""text/plain"";
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++)
        {
            context.Response.Write(""Hello World "" + i + Environment.NewLine);

<p>Pushes Hello World bit by bit to the client...This works on a synchronious request, I'll see if a xmlHttpRequest gets a readystatechange event for each line.</p>

<p>I've always avoiding multithreading on ASP.NET apps because you don't have control of when the working process will die, which will result in all of its spawned threads dieing.</p>

<p>Instead, why re-invent a separate thread pool when IIS is already doing this for you.</p>

<p>Edit:  There are tons of codes - it's possible that every code is different.</p>

<p>EPILOGUE:  I've selected Darius Bacon as best answer, because I think the best algorithm is a modification of the majority element he linked to.  The majority algorithm should be modifiable to only use a tiny amount of memory - like 201 codes to get 1/2% I think.  Basically you just walk the stream counting up to 201 distinct codes.  As soon as you find 201 distinct codes, you drop one of each code (deduct 1 from the counters, forgetting anything that becomes 0).  At the end, you have dropped at most N/201 times, so any code occurring more times than that must still be around.</p>

<p>But it's a two pass algorithm, not one.  You need a second pass to tally the counts of the candidates.  It's actually easy to see that any solution to this problem must use at least 2 passes (the first batch of elements you load could all be different and one of those codes could end up being exactly 1/2%)</p>

HEXADECIMAL:   05 ae fe 2a 3d cd
     BINARY:   00000101 10101110 11111110 00101010 00111101 11001101
    DECIMAL:   5 174 254 42 61 205
</code></pre>

<p>What's the logic to convert from BASE64 to HEXIDECIMAL?<br>
Why is the decimal representation split up?<br>
How come the binary representation is split into 6 section?  </p>

<p>Just want the math, the code I can handle just this process is confusing me. Thanks :)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Unfortunately a callback does not work as the JavaScript function that calls onApplicationUnload() itself has to return a value (similar to the onApplicationUnload() function in Flex). This JavaScript function has a fixed signature as it is called by a framework and I cannot change it. Or in other words: The call from JavaScript to Flex must also be synchronous.</p>

"297889","1","","","2008-11-18 04:56:32","","2","5177","<p>I have an MDI application that allows me to open different types of child windows.  I can open multiple (but different) instances of the same type of child window.  (Example: I can open 3 instances of child window type A and 2 instances of child window type B.  All 5 windows are distinct entities and do not share data until unless the user explicitly drags the same data onto multiple windows.)  Each child window has a ToolStripContainer with one or more ToolStrips.  How do I prevent:</p>

<ol>
<li>the user from dragging a ToolStrip from a child window of type A to a ToolStripContainer in a child window of type B?</li>
<li>the user from dragging a ToolStrip from one instance of child window A to a ToolStripContainer in another instances of the same type of window?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm trying to prevent the user from dragging a ToolStrip from instance 1 of type A to instance 2 of type A, selecting some stuff on instance 2, and then clicking a button on the toolbar only to have something weird happen to some other window.  Similarly it doesn't make sense to drag a ToolStrip from a window of type A to a window of type B -- the actions don't apply to that type, but to the user it looks like everything is fine because I let them do the drag.</p>

<p>Is it as simple as adding my own handler for the ControlAdded event or is there a better way to do this?  I'm using WinForms in .NET 3.0.</p>

<p>edit: Steps to reproduce</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new Windows Application project.</li>
<li>Add a new user control.  Give the control a ToolStripContainer that contains one ToolStrip with a single button.</li>
<li>Repeat step 2, giving you a UserControl2 class.</li>
<li>Compile the solution so UserControl1 and UserControl2 show up in your toolbox.</li>
<li>Drag UserControl1 and UserControl2 onto the form.  Set the borders so you know where the boundaries are.</li>
<li>Run the app.</li>
<li>It's now possible to drag the ToolStrip from the container in UserControl1 and drop it into the container in UserControl2 (leaving zero ToolStrips in UC1 and two ToolStrips in UC2.)</li>
<li>Now imagine you only have access to the code in UserControl1.  How do you prevent the user from dragging the ToolStrip out of that instance of the ToolStripContainer?</li>

<p>Basically, I was looking for a way to do constant updates to a web page from a long process. I thought AJAX was the way to go, but Dave has <a href=""http://encosia.com/2007/10/03/easy-incremental-status-updates-for-long-requests/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a nice article about using JavaScript</a>. I integrated it into my application and it worked great on my client, but NOT my server WebHost4Life. I have another server @ Brinkster and decided to try it there and it DOES work. All the code is the same on my client, WebHost4Life, and Brinkster, so there's obviously something going on with WebHost4Life.</p>

<p>I'm planning to write an email to them or request technical support, but I'd like to be proactive and try to figure out what could be going on with their end to cause this difference. I did everything I could with my code to turn off Buffering like <code>Page.Response.BufferOutput = False</code>. What server settings could they have implemented to cause this difference? Is there any way I could circumvent it on my own without their help? If not, what would they need to do?</p>

<p>For reference, a link to the working version of a simpler version of my application is located @ <a href=""http://www.jasoncomedy.com/javascriptfun/javascriptfun.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.jasoncomedy.com/javascriptfun/javascriptfun.aspx</a> and the same version that isn't working is located @ <a href=""http://www.tabroom.org/Ajaxfun/Default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.tabroom.org/Ajaxfun/Default.aspx</a>. You'll notice in the working version, you get updates with each step, but in the one that doesn't, it sits there for a long time until everything is done and then does all the updates to the client at once ... and that makes me sad.</p>

There is an API available but Infoblox's documentation and examples are not very practical.</p>

<p>I would like to search via the API for details about an IP. To start with - I would be happy to get anything back from the server. I modified <a href=""http://www.infoblox.com/community/blog/using-python-nios-rest-api"" rel=""nofollow"">the only example I found</a></p>

search_string = {'network':'10.233.84.0/22'}

response = requests.get(url + object_type, verify=False,
  data=json.dumps(search_string), auth=('adminname', 'adminpass'))

print ""status code: "", response.status_code
print response.text

<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Following up on the solution, below is a piece of code (it works but it is not nice, streamlined, does not perfectly checks for errors, etc.) if someone one day would have a need to do the same as I did.</p>

I am using the Visual Studio 2005 Bootstrapper for this task.
To this end, I did the following:
Located the folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\SDK\v2.0\BootStrapper\Packages\ and created a folder for my prerequisite (made it same structure as 'dotnetfx'); created the 'product.xml' and 'package.xml' and placed them appropriately. I kept the xml files very simple so far to test the installation:</p>

  &lt;Commands Reboot=""None""&gt;
    &lt;Command PackageFile=""MyPrereq.exe"" EstimatedInstallSeconds=""90""&gt;
      &lt;InstallConditions&gt;
      &lt;/InstallConditions&gt;
      &lt;ExitCodes&gt;
    &lt;ExitCode Value=""0"" Result=""Success""/&gt;
        &lt;DefaultExitCode Result=""Fail"" String=""GeneralFailure"" FormatMessageFromSystem=""true"" /&gt;
      &lt;/ExitCodes&gt;
    &lt;/Command&gt;
  &lt;/Commands&gt;
&lt;/Product&gt;

<p>package.xml</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;Package Name=""MyPrereq"" Culture=""Culture"" xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/2004/01/bootstrapper""&gt;

    &lt;String Name=""GeneralFailure""&gt;A fatal error occurred. The installation failed.&lt;/String&gt;
  &lt;/Strings&gt;
&lt;/Package&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can add the prerequisite from the list and build my setup project.</p>

<p>The problem:</p>

<p>The build output is the 'setup.exe', the 'MyApp.msi' package, plus the subfolder called 'MyPrereq' which contains 'MyPrereq.exe'.</p>

<p>I would like the build to create a 'setup.exe' and a single 'MyApp.msi', which would contain the 'MyPrereq' inside, with no additional files/directories.</p>

<p>I know that the .NET framework is another prereq for my app, and it is included in the same .msi, so that should be possible somehow.</p>

<p>How can I achieve this? </p>

<p>But the award for Accepted Answer has to go to Paolo Bergantino for the mechanism of adding a class name to mark the dragged element, which saved me some more work!</p>

<hr />

<p>In my HTML I have a table with an image link on each row.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table class=""search_results""&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td class=""thumbnail""&gt;&lt;a href=""...""&gt;&lt;img src=""..."" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>An included javascript file contains the code to make the images draggable</p>

<pre><code>$$( "".thumbnail a img"" ).each(
  function( img )
  {
    new Draggable( img, {revert:true} );
  }
);
</code></pre>

<p>and a simple handler to detect the end of the drag</p>

<pre><code>Draggables.addObserver({
  onEnd:function( eventName, draggable, event )
  {
    // alert ( eventName ); // leaving this in stops IE from following the link
    event.preventDefault(); // Does Not Work !!!
    // event.stop(); // Does Not Work either !!!
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>My idea is that when the image is clicked the link should be followed but when it is dragged something else should happen.</p>

<p>In fact what happens is that when the image is dragged the handler is called but the link is still followed.</p>

<p>I guess that I'm cancelling the wrong event.</p>

<p>How can I prevent the link from being followed after the element is dragged?</p>

<hr />

<p>edit: added event.stop after trying greystate's suggestion</p>

<hr />

<p>I now have a basic solution that works for FireFox, Apache, etc. See my own answer below.</p>

<p>But I am still looking for a solution for IE7 (and hopefully IE6).</p>

<p>Another problem when dragging images in IE is that the image becomes detached from the mouse pointer when the tool tip appears, you have to release the mouse and click again on the image to re-acquire the drag. So I'm also looking for any ideas that might help resolve that problem.</p>

It claims to be ""the last binary standard"".</p>

<p>It is a standard to store XML data optimized for
processing and storage, is bundled with XML schema (making the data
strongly typed and strongly structured). Well, there are a lot of
claimed advantages. I was impressed most by the processing and
memory-efficiency measurements.</p>

<p>I am asking myself, what is going to happen to all the established
XML APIs?</p>

<p>There is this paragraph related to my question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4.2 Existing XML Processing APIs</p>
  
  <p>As EXI is an encoding of the XML Infoset, an EXI implementation can support any of the commonly-used XML APIs for XML processing, so EXI has no immediate impact on existing XML APIs. However, using an existing XML API also requires that all names and text appearing in the EXI document be converted into strings. In the future, more efficiency might be achievable if the higher layers could directly use these data as typed values appearing in the EXI document. For instance, if a higher layer needs typed data, going through its string form can produce a performance penalty, so an extended API that supports typed data directly could improve performance when used with EXI. </p>
  
  <p>from: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/exi-impacts/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.w3.org/TR/exi-impacts/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand it as following: <i>""Using EXI with existing APIs?
No performance gain! (Unless you rewrite them all)""</i></p>

<p>Let's take the Java ecosystem as an example:</p>

<p>We have plenty of XML APIs in latest JDK 6
(With each major JDK release, more and more of them were added.)
As far as I can judge, most (if not all) of them are using either
in-memory DOM trees, or serialized (""textual"") representation
to transform/process/validate/... XML data.</p>

<p>What do you guys think, what is going to happen to these
APIs with introduction of EXI?</p>

<p>Thank you all for your opinions.</p>

<p>The most recent time I came up with it was when studying type checkers. Our class realized that it would be impossible to write a perfect type checker (one that would accept all programs that would run without type errors, and reject all programs that would run with type errors) because this would, in fact, solve the halting problem. Another was when we realized, in the same class, that it would be impossible to determine whether a division would ever occur by zero, in the type-checking stage, because checking whether a number, at run-time, is zero, is also a version of the halting problem.</p>

Unfortunately I don't have an easy way to use bulk insert or BCP or any of the other ways that a normal human would go about this.  The inserts will happen on one particular database but that code needs to be db agnostic -- so I can't do bulk copy, or SELECT INTO, or BCP.

<p>A new functionality will require me to accept files through this webservice. Basically I'm allowing users to upload files to a file archive through the API, which they'd otherwise do by logging into our browser based administration system.</p>

<p>The API needs to be as easily consumed as possible. I'm thinking of dropping SOAP support since our PHP clients mainly use the GET/POST methods, and the .NET clients don't mind either way. With that as a prerequisite, I'm thinking of simply creating an UploadFile(fileName) method, and the requiring the user to send the file through POST as a normal file upload.</p>

<p>However, I will not be able to specify the file field as a parameter to the method, right? So if I simply state in the documentation ""file should be sent in POST field called 'File'"", would that pose any problems when I need to read the file?</p>

<p>All files are in binary format, PDF's, various image formats, FLV and so forth. Also, file sizes will mainly be in the 2-20MB vicinity, but given the above solution, would I have any troubles accepting files in the 250MB area?</p>

<p>Receiving a file this way would result in the file being loaded completely into memory, before I write it to disk - is there any way around this, besides letting the service receive a Stream and thus disabling me from accepting other parameters, and hindering the easy usage of the service?</p>

<hr>

<p>Besides what's possible on my side, I'm also curious in regards to how I make it as easy as possible for the callees to send the file. I'm guessing POST is one of the most accessible ways of receiving the file, but if anyone has any comments, I'd like to hear them as well.</p>

<p>First, the symptom: While running pretty standard code that uses waveOutWrite() to output PCM audio, I sometimes get this when running under the debugger:</p>

<pre><code> ntdll.dll!_DbgBreakPoint@0()   
 ntdll.dll!_RtlpBreakPointHeap@4()  + 0x28 bytes    
 ntdll.dll!_RtlpValidateHeapEntry@12()  + 0x113 bytes

 wdmaud.drv!_waveThread@4()  + 0x9c bytes   
 kernel32.dll!_BaseThreadStart@8()  + 0x37 bytes    
</code></pre>

<p>While the obvious suspect would be a heap corruption somewhere else in the code, I found out that that's not the case. Furthermore, I was able to reproduce this problem using the following code (this is part of a dialog based MFC application:)</p>

<pre><code>void CwaveoutDlg::OnBnClickedButton1()
{
    WAVEFORMATEX wfx;
    wfx.nSamplesPerSec = 44100; /* sample rate */
    wfx.wBitsPerSample = 16; /* sample size */
    wfx.nChannels = 2;
    wfx.cbSize = 0; /* size of _extra_ info */
    wfx.wFormatTag = WAVE_FORMAT_PCM;
    wfx.nBlockAlign = (wfx.wBitsPerSample &gt;&gt; 3) * wfx.nChannels;
    wfx.nAvgBytesPerSec = wfx.nBlockAlign * wfx.nSamplesPerSec;

    waveOutOpen(&amp;hWaveOut, 
                WAVE_MAPPER, 
                &amp;wfx,  
                (DWORD_PTR)m_hWnd, 
                0,
                CALLBACK_WINDOW );

    ZeroMemory(&amp;header, sizeof(header));
    header.dwBufferLength = 4608;
    header.lpData = (LPSTR)GlobalLock(GlobalAlloc(GMEM_MOVEABLE | GMEM_SHARE | GMEM_ZEROINIT, 4608));

    waveOutPrepareHeader(hWaveOut, &amp;header, sizeof(header));
    waveOutWrite(hWaveOut, &amp;header, sizeof(header));
}

afx_msg LRESULT CwaveoutDlg::OnWOMDone(WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
    HWAVEOUT dev = (HWAVEOUT)wParam;
    WAVEHDR *hdr = (WAVEHDR*)lParam;
    waveOutUnprepareHeader(dev, hdr, sizeof(WAVEHDR));
    GlobalFree(GlobalHandle(hdr-&gt;lpData));
    ZeroMemory(hdr, sizeof(*hdr));
    hdr-&gt;dwBufferLength = 4608;
    hdr-&gt;lpData = (LPSTR)GlobalLock(GlobalAlloc(GMEM_MOVEABLE | GMEM_SHARE | GMEM_ZEROINIT, 4608));
    waveOutPrepareHeader(hWaveOut, &amp;header, sizeof(WAVEHDR));
    waveOutWrite(hWaveOut, hdr, sizeof(WAVEHDR));
    return 0;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Before anyone comments on this, yes - the sample code plays back uninitialized memory. Don't try this with your speakers turned all the way up.</p>

<p>Some debugging revealed the following information: waveOutPrepareHeader() populates header.reserved with a pointer to what appears to be a structure containing at least two pointers as its first two members. The first pointer is set to NULL. After calling waveOutWrite(), this pointer is set to a pointer allocated on the global heap. In pseudo code, that would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>struct Undocumented { void *p1, *p2; } /* This might have more members */

MMRESULT waveOutPrepareHeader( handle, LPWAVEHDR hdr, ...) {
    hdr-&gt;reserved = (Undocumented*)calloc(sizeof(Undocumented));
    /* Do more stuff... */
}

MMRESULT waveOutWrite( handle, LPWAVEHDR hdr, ...) {

    /* The following assignment fails rarely, causing the problem: */
    hdr-&gt;reserved-&gt;p1 = malloc( /* chunk of private data */ );
    /* Probably more code to initiate playback */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Normally, the header is returned to the application by waveCompleteHeader(), a function internal to wdmaud.dll. waveCompleteHeader() tries to deallocate the pointer allocated by waveOutWrite() by calling GlobalHandle()/GlobalUnlock() and friends. Sometimes, GlobalHandle() bombs, as shown above.</p>

<p>Now, the reason that GlobalHandle() bombs is not due to a heap corruption, as I suspected at first - it's because waveOutWrite() returned without setting the first pointer in the internal structure to a valid pointer. I suspect that it frees the memory pointed to by that pointer before returning, but I haven't disassembled it yet.</p>

<p>This only appears to happen when the wave playback system is low on buffers, which is why I'm using a single header to reproduce this.</p>

<p>At this point I have a pretty good case against this being a bug in my application - after all, my application is not even running. Has anyone seen this before?</p>

<p>I'm seeing this on Windows XP SP2. The audio card is from SigmaTel, and the driver version is 5.10.0.4995.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>To prevent confusion in the future, I'd like to point out that the answer suggesting that the problem lies with the use of malloc()/free() to manage the buffers being played is simply wrong. You'll note that I changed the code above to reflect the suggestion, to prevent more people from making the same mistake - it doesn't make a difference. The buffer being freed by waveCompleteHeader() is not the one containing the PCM data, the responsibility to free the PCM buffer lies with the application, and there's no requirement that it be allocated in any specific way.</p>

<p>Also, I make sure that none of the waveOut API calls I use fail.</p>

<p>I'm currently assuming that this is either a bug in Windows, or in the audio driver. Dissenting opinions are always welcome.</p>

<ol>
<li>Anything from ProjectA that has not been merged</li>
<li>If the LATEST from ProjectA has been merged to Ver2, then get the LATEST from Ver2 branch</li>
<li>If there is not a ProjectA branch, get from Ver2</li>
<li>If there is no Ver2, get from MAIN</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, in the above case, if I merged version 1 from ProjectA to version 2 in Ver2 branch, then I would want to see version 3 on Ver2.  However, if I have not yet merged those files, I would want version 1 from ProjectA in my view.</p>

<p>If the limited user in XP is the FIRST user to launch the application it creates the files fine and both the limited user and administrators can run fine.</p>

<p>The two files that it is NOT able to read/write to if created by an Administrator is a Log4Net log file and a SQLite db file.</p>

<p>The SQLite database file is being created with a straitforward .NET File.Copy(sourcepath, destinationpath).  The sourcepath is a seed database file installed with the application - so on first run it copies that from the C:\Program Files\app install\seed.db</p>

<p>Is there a way to set the permissions on the file when I copy it?  File.SetAccessControl() perhaps?  I am not clear on how that works.</p>

<p>The other issue is that the log4Net rolling file appender will not roll the old file and create a new as the old file was created by the admin user when they ran the app.</p>

Any lock in general, spinlock, ReaderWriterLock, whatever.
Calling Dispose myself defeats the purpose of the pattern - to have the lock released as soon as we exit scope - no matter if we called return in the middle, threw exception or whatnot.

<p>The proof-of-concept prototype (a simple ASP.NET page that queries a single item from the database and opens Excel to add data to a worksheet) is working well when run locally on the development machines, happily creating and displaying an Excel spreadsheet as requested.  However, when run on our server, we get the following error upon trying to instantiate Excel .</p>

<p>Unable to cast COM object of type 'Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.ApplicationClass' to interface type 'Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel._Application'.

<p>Here's the deal:</p>

<p>MAINAPP.EXE References an hypothetical LIBRARY.DLL.</p>

<p>MAINAPP.EXE has its own MAINAPP.EXE.config.</p>

<p>If you add ""config values"" to LIBRARY.DLL (thereby creating an app.config in LIBRARY.DLL project), those values are <em>not</em> available at runtime <em>even if you copy app.config into LIBRARY.DLL.config to the right path post-build</em>.</p>

<p>The reason for the above is that even referenced libraries will read from the ""mainapp.exe"" config. </p>

<p>So far ""so good"". Now, when you add a WCF Service reference, visual studio creates or populates your app.config with the bindings/endpoints/etc.; but that's added to the project where you added the reference's config; hence, your Library.DLL.prj ends up with a nice app.config that <em>doesn't work</em> because it never gets read, nor even copied to the output directory. Now you may think that you can right click that app.config and set ""copy always"" to true. Forget it. That doesn't do anything. (You can google for that one).</p>

<p>So, given the above weird scenario, how is a regular VS2008 developer working with a .NET 3.5 project going to manage the WCF service references he adds to his Business Layer dll? Is that developer supposed to COPY and PASTE all the whole  section from the <em>useless</em> app.config in his DLL to the Mainapp.exe.config file <em>each time there's a change in the services or each time he adds/removes one</em> ?</p>

<p>I wonder if this is a good practice for writing domain models as well. So, for example if you've got a domain class Customer and each customer may have a list of Orders, would you <em>generally</em> also write interfaces ICustomer and IOrder. And also would Customer have a list of IOrders instead of Orders? Or would you use interfaces in the domain model, only if it is really driven by the domain, e.g. you've got at least two different types of Orders?

              DataView dv = new DataView(dt);
              dv.Sort = e.SortExpression + "" "" + e.SortDirection;

Now I'm reading about __autoload and thinking that it could make the process of developing my applications much easier.

Unfortunately it seems that <em>KPI</em> is a four-letter word, and the immediate assumption is that KPIs are always mis-used (maybe they are?).</p>

<p>So, I've hopefully improved the question to get at the underlying goals which I originally thought KPIs were useful for. Assuming you have some process for how you (or your organisation) develops software. Secondly assume, that you (or your team) wants to become better at developing and delivery software. Finally, assume that one of the ways to improve is by refining your process. </p>

<p>Given all this, how do you know if your process refinements are having a positive impact? If these are <em>KPIs</em>, or [SMART goals](<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_(project_management)"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_(project_management)</a> please provide individual, or groups, of KPIs/SMART goals that you have found the be effective. If it is some other mechanism please explain what it is. Finally, I guess, if you don't think that improving processes is a useful thing, I guess you can explain that too.</p>

<p>The areas of improvement I think would be useful are: quality, timeliness of releases, productivity, flexibility. If there are other aspects of an individual or team of developers, then that would be interesting to know.</p>

<p>Clarifying notes:</p>

<p>The question is not about how to best adapt or change a process, or what a good process improvement process is (be it Kaizen, retrospectives, etc). Nor is it about root-cause analysis or other approaches used to determine what specific aspects of a process should be improved.</p>

<p>The use of measures to determine if process improvement has been achieved, should not be confused with ongoing, as it happens, process improvement. (That is a good thing, but it isn't what the question is about!)</p>

<p>The <em>process</em> could be anything; scrum, agile, extreme, waterfall, ad-hoc. This question isn't about which process is best for certain types of software development, rather it is how to improve that process over time.</p>

<p>Obviously the specific metric will depend on the process that is involved, and the perceived problem that is trying to be improved. This question is simply designed to get examples of metrics used, which would obviously span a number of different processes and improvement areas.</p>

<p>The metric need not be something that is used <em>all the time</em>, for example, it could just be used while testing if a process change works. (For example, it could be too expensive - time or money wise - to measure and track at all times, so you just track it will tweaking the process).</p>

<p>It is taken as a given that if implemented poorly, the use of metrics can have a detrimental effect as developers game the system or otherwise. It is assumed that the person implementing the process change is aware of this problem and has taken effective steps to mitigate it.</p>

<p>All software organisations are different and how they fit into their company, so will have different specific things expected of them within the company, however I would think that product quality, productivity, flexibility and timeliness of releases are applicable to most if not all organisations. (With obviously different emphasis depending on the specific organisation.)</p>

<p>This question has nothing to do with <em>source lines of code</em>! In particular, I am not interested in measuring programmer productivity, especially in terms of SLOCs or # of bugs fixed, or any other naive measurements. I'm interested in higher-level way a team or individual measures their improvement. I am not interested in using a single KPI to measure anyone's performance. I <strong>am</strong> interested in using a range of KPIs to measure and improve my team's software development processes.</p>

<p>I know of horror stories about KPIs being misused and being ineffective (you don't need to search very hard to find them), but I can't believe that no-one out there tries to continually improve their processes, so there must be some good examples of KPIs out there.</p>

<p>I know all about the drawbacks of simplistic metrics that are applied to individual software programmers. I am really hoping to get examples of KPIs or alternative strategies that people have found as useful, rather than all the reasons why I shouldn't be using KPIs.</p>

<p>I'm mostly interested in processes and performance related to a development organisation within a larger company, as opposed to a software development company as a whole. For example, a software company should ensure that the products have the right features for the market, but generally that is product management's role, rather than engineering. And yes, there is a complete other discussion as to why and to what extent engineers should be involved in product management, but that is a separate discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Solutions which do not work (properly)</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Using java.nio.channels.FileLock</em><br>
I am able to synchronize threads from different servers using the FileLock class. But this does not work for threads
inside the same process (servlet container) since file locks are available process wide.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Using a separate file for synchronization</em><br>
I could create a separate file which indicates that a process is reading from or wrinting to the file. This solution
works for all threads but has several drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance. Creating, deleting and checking files are rather slow operations. The low weight implementations with one synchronization file will prevent parallel reading of the file.</li>
<li>The synchronization file will remain after a JVM crash making a manual clean up necessary.</li>
<li>We have had already strange problems deleting files on network file systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Using messaging</em><br>
We could implement a messaging system which the threads would use to coordinate the file access. But this seems too complex for this problem. And again: performance will be poor.</p></li>

For the secondary table it always returns the rows whose foreign key column value matches the primary key column value of the <strong>first row</strong> of the primary table. </p>

<p>Following is a very simplified example for what I want to do in the real stored procedure.
Names is the primary table</p>

<pre><code>SET NOCOUNT ON
DECLARE 
    @Fname varchar(50) -- to hold the fname column value from outer cursor loop
    ,@FK_Fname varchar(50) -- to hold the fname column value from inner cursor loop
    ,@score int
;

--prepare primary table to be iterated in the  outer loop
DECLARE @Names AS Table (Fname varchar(50))
INSERT @Names
    SELECT 'Jim' UNION
    SELECT 'Bob' UNION
    SELECT 'Sam' UNION
    SELECT 'Jo' 


--prepare secondary/detail table to be iterated in the inner loop
DECLARE @Scores AS Table (Fname varchar(50), Score int)
INSERT @Scores
    SELECT 'Jo',1 UNION
    SELECT 'Jo',5 UNION
    SELECT 'Jim',4 UNION
    SELECT 'Bob',10 UNION
    SELECT 'Bob',15 

--cursor to iterate on the primary table in the outer loop
DECLARE curNames CURSOR
FOR SELECT Fname FROM @Names


OPEN curNames
FETCH NEXT FROM curNames INTO @Fname

--cursor to iterate on the secondary table in the inner loop
DECLARE curScores CURSOR
FOR 
    SELECT FName,Score 
    FROM @Scores 
    WHERE Fname = @Fname 
 --*** NOTE: Using the primary table's column value @Fname from the outer loop

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    PRINT 'Outer loop @Fname = ' + @Fname

    OPEN curScores
    FETCH NEXT FROM curScores INTO @FK_Fname, @Score

    WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
    BEGIN
        PRINT ' FK_Fname=' + @FK_Fname + '. Score=' + STR(@Score)
        FETCH NEXT FROM curScores INTO @FK_Fname, @Score
    END
    CLOSE curScores
    FETCH NEXT FROM curNames INTO @Fname
END

DEALLOCATE curScores

CLOSE curNames
DEALLOCATE curNames
</code></pre>

<p>Here is what I get for the result. Please note that for the outer loop it DOES show the up-to-date Fname, but when that Fname is used as @Fname to fetch the relevant row from the secondary table for the succeeding iterations, it still get the rows that match the first row (Bob) of the primary table.</p>

<pre><code>Outer loop @Fname = Bob
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=10
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=15
Outer loop @Fname = Jim
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=10
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=15
Outer loop @Fname = Jo
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=10
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=15
Outer loop @Fname = Sam
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=10
    FK_Fname=Bob. Score=15
</code></pre>

<p>Please let me know what am I do wrong.
Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>My goal is to port a legacy Java EE application (pre-EJB 3.x) to Tomcat with embedded EJB container. My choices currently stand as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>JBoss Embeddable EJB</li>
<li>Apache OpenEJB</li>
<li>OW2 Consortium EasyBeans</li>
<li>anything else?</li>
</ul>

<p>I am expecting to use JMS (with MDBs), Session beans (stateful and stateless), JPA and I am really excited about using JSF with Seam. </p>

<p>Now, given choices above, are there any advantages in using one or another embedded EJB provider?</p>

<pre><code>
class A
{
public:
    A(int whichFoo);
    int foo1();
    int foo2();
    int foo3();
    int callFoo(); // cals one of the foo's depending on the value of whichFoo
};
</code></pre>

<p>In my current implementation I save the value of <code>whichFoo</code> in a data member in the constructor and use a <code>switch</code> in <code>callFoo()</code> to decide which of the foo's to call.  Alternatively, I can use a <code>switch</code> in the constructor to save a pointer to the right <code>fooN()</code> to be called in <code>callFoo()</code>. </p>

<p>My question is which way is more efficient if an object of class A is only constructed once, while <code>callFoo()</code> is called a very large number of times.  So in the first case we have multiple executions of a switch statement, while in the second there is only one switch, and multiple calls of a member function using the pointer to it.  I know that calling a member function using a pointer is slower than just calling it directly.  Does anybody know if this overhead is more or less than the cost of a <code>switch</code>?</p>

<p>Clarification:  I realize that you never really know which approach gives better performance until you try it and time it.  However, in this case I already have approach 1 implemented, and I wanted to find out if approach 2 can be more efficient at least in principle.  It appears that it can be, and now it makes sense for me to bother to implement it and try it.  </p>

<p>Oh, and I also like approach 2 better for aesthetic reasons.  I guess I am looking for a justification to implement it. :) </p>

I was looking to use JSP pages with tag libraries for handling the view layer and formatting of the HTML, but I've come across another group in my company that uses Velocity templates for the same purpose.</p>

<p>From what I can see, it seems to me as if there are a lot of similarities between the two approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>Both have easy-to-understand syntax. Makes it easy for non-developers to understand and use, allowing the designers to focus on the HTML/CSS and only having to use directives/tag libraries in the few cases where they need conditionals/dynamic content without having to have a full understanding of Java.  </li>
<li>Simple to see which part of the content is HTML vs which are directives/logic.</li>
<li>Both are heavily used and well supported.</li>
<li>Simple to integrate with Spring MVC.</li>
</ol>

<p>But in comparing the two technologies, I can't see any specific reasons to use one versus the other. I'm having trouble thinking of any cons specific to either Velocity or JSTL.</p>

<p>So my question is, what are the pros and cons of each in your opinion? If you have built a (Spring) MVC app using one or the other, what made you decide on the view layer technology you are using and what (if anything) made you decide against the other?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've found a similar  discussion of this same topic archived on the Spring Framework forum's <a href=""http://forum.springframework.org/archive/index.php/t-10443.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, which might be of some interest to anyone making the same decision between JSTL and Velocity as I am.</p>

<p>This works - I get all products from all vendors.</p>

<p>Now I have a list of conditions, built up at runtime by the user. Let's apply them:</p>

<p>To me, this smells like ""a"" is overwritten somewhere with each trip trough the loop, and only the last one applies.</p>

<p>Short of somehow writing an extension method to IEnumerable called ContainsAll(IEnumerable) or something to that effect, how can I achieve what I want, which is basically a logical AND, giving me only those products that has ALL the required attributes?</p>

In Java Mail 1.4.1 there is a <a href=""http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/javadocs/javax/mail/internet/MimeMessage.html#MimeMessage(javax.mail.Session,%20java.io.InputStream)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MimeMessage constructor that accepts a stream</a>.  My understanding is that I could pass a stream to this constructor and it would parse it for me into a MimeMessage.  I wrote 2 tests to prove this.  The first test sends in a stream that contains only a partial multi-part MIME message.  The second test sends in a stream that contains 2 complete multi-part MIME messages.  Neither work the way I expected.  The first does not throw an exception and the second reads the entire stream into a single message somehow.  Is this a bug in Java Mail or am I using the wrong kind of streams?  Or am I missing something bigger?</p>

They might have a memory offset for health, x/y position, etc.  Every time the game releases an update the offsets for the various pieces of information the bot program uses must be re-found and updated as well.</p>

<p>I'm interested in writing a Solitaire bot as a pet project.  If you look here, mmoglider (a commercial bot) has already accomplished this as a demo for their botting program (which normally is used to bot WoW): <a href=""http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Oy9fOwyr4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YouTube video of MMOGlider botting Vista Solitaire.</a></p>

<p>What is a common method of accurately locating various useful memory offsets?  How might I go about locating the memory offset that points to the ""deck"" in the solitaire program and use that to determine what cards are on the stack?  I know from experience with the glider guys that once they were able to locate the offsets for the deck itself they said that every card value for the entire deck was there.</p>

<p><strong><em>So, does anyone have any experience with reverse engineering and pulling memory offsets out of existing programs? And once you have those offsets how to be able to pull and read the values from that ""Deck"" structure in memory?</em></strong></p>

The general idea is to set the font-size in your body tag to  e.g. ""94%"" and then set all other elements with an ""em"" size like this. The reasoning is:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can then change the relative size of all the font sizes on your site by modifying the body's font-size at one point</li>
<li>users themselves can modify the size of the fonts since they are defined in ""em""</li>
</ul>

<p>However, when using ""em"" instead of ""pt"" I constantly run into issues such as the following where an element with font-size gets embedded in another element with font-size and thus becomes tiny (in the case below one vocabulary word is .8 of .8 and the other is .8 of 1.2).</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;style type=""text/css""&gt;
        body {
            font-size: 94%;
        }
        p {
            font-size: .8em;
        }
        li {
            font-size: 1.2em;
        }
        .vocabulary {
            font-size: .8em;
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;span class=""vocabulary""&gt;egregious&lt;/span&gt; test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This is in a &lt;span class=""vocabulary""&gt;superb&lt;/span&gt; list.&lt;/li&gt;

<p>Of course in very simple, straight-forward HTML sites this is no problem, but in the real world with imported stylesheets that perhaps you didn't even make and with dynamic sites where controls are embedded in other controls all of them outputting HTML with perhaps in-line styling, I find websites with ""em"" unit font-sizes are sometimes impossible to maintain and the way to get font-size under control is to just convert everything to hard ""px"" sizes.</p>

<p>In addition, I just checked the four main browsers and each of them have hotkeys which increase and decrease the size of ""pt"" styled fonts.</p>

<p>So here are my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>is there any real-world reason why I should use ""em"" instead of ""pt""?</li>
<li>is there trick in using ""em"" sizes so that I don't run into the embedded font-size issue above?</li>

Within A I have another internal component C, which is specified using mxml. When ""instantiating"" component A within mxml, I can specify the value of b at declaration, and everything works fine. However, when I initialize the component using Actionscript, I must first add the component to a rendered container before I can set the attribute (in this case 'b') of said component. This happens when the setter for attribute 'b' somehow accesses C within A.</p>

<p>So, this fails at runtime (it says that C is null)...</p>

<pre><code>var a:A = new A();
a.b = ""woopy""; //Sets the Label (declared in mxml) withn A to ""woopy""
this.addChild(a);
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, either of the following will work</p>

<pre><code>&lt;customNamespace:A b=""woopy""/&gt;

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>var a:A = new A();
this.addChild(a);
a.b = ""woopy""; //Sets the Label (declared in mxml) withn A to ""woopy""
</code></pre>

<p>As shown, no runtime error message is thrown when a attribute is set after a component is added to a container. Ok, this makes sense, I suppose the internals of the component are not actually created until the component is added to a container. Still, this is kind of annoying. Is there any way to guarantee that the component internals are fully rendered without adding it to a container? I don't like the way it feels different when I am using actionscript vs mxml. I want a solution so that basically declaring A in mxml with no attribute ""arguments"" is equivalent to declaring A using the new operator in AS. At least, in terms of the internal state of A.</p>

I've got the basic testing going nicely (testing the ActionResult classes is pretty nice). One thing I do want to make sure though, is that a viewpage exists in my solution. I'm not 100% sure my test is correct, so if anyone had suggestions, please don't hesitate!</p>

<p>This is a test I have to check that my login method on my security controller is doing the right thing:</p>

<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public void Login()
{
    var authProvider = new Mock&lt;IAuthenticationProvider&gt;();
    var controller = new SecurityController(authProvider.Object);

    var result = controller.Login() as ViewResult;

    Assert.IsNotNull(result, ""ActionResult should be of type ViewResult."");
    Assert.AreEqual(result.ViewName, ""login"", ""Does not render login page."");
}
</code></pre>

<p>My explanation of the test would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>call the method 'Login' on the controller</li>
<li>Confirm it's rendering a view (by checking if it returns a ViewResult object)</li>
<li>Confirm it's rendering the right view (by checking the viewname)</li>
</ul>

<p>What I would like to have is a third assert, to see if the view to be rendered actually exists.</p>

<p>Some secondary questions I have would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I split this test up?</li>
<li>Should I rename it (like, err, LoginRendersCorrectView or something)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Note: I'm explicitly trying to avoid having to check the filesystem. I'm sort of hoping for a way to use the ViewEngine to confirm the view actually exists.</p>

In short, what it needs to do is to display a list of film titles, and allow users to give a rating (out of 10) to each film. I've been able to use the {{ form }} and {{ formset }} syntax in a template to produce a form which lets you rate one film at a time, which corresponds to one row in a MySQL table, but how do I produce a form that iterates over all the movie titles in the database and produces a form that lets you rate lots of them at once? </p>

<p>At first, I thought this was what formsets were for, but I can't see any way to automatically iterate over the contents of a database table to produce items to go in the form, if you see what I mean.</p>

<p>Currently, my views.py has this code:</p>

<pre><code>def survey(request):
        ScoreFormSet = formset_factory(ScoreForm)
        if request.method == 'POST':
                formset = ScoreFormSet(request.POST, request.FILES)
                if formset.is_valid():
                        return HttpResponseRedirect('/')
        else:
                formset = ScoreFormSet()
        return render_to_response('cf/survey.html', {
                'formset':formset,
        })
</code></pre>

<p>And my survey.html has this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""/survey/"" method=""POST""&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
{{ formset }}
&lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;input type = ""submit"" value = ""Submit""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, and the definition of ScoreForm and Score from models.py are:</p>

<pre><code>class Score(models.Model):
        movie = models.ForeignKey(Movie)
        score = models.IntegerField()
        user = models.ForeignKey(User)

class ScoreForm(ModelForm):
        class Meta:
                model = Score
</code></pre>

<p>So, in case the above is not clear, what I'm aiming to produce is a form which has one row per movie, and each row shows a title, and has a box to allow the user to enter their score.</p>

<p>If anyone can point me at the right sort of approach to this, I'd be most grateful.</p>

"439540","1","439587","","2009-01-13 16:01:39","","5","5250","<p>First of all I have to admit that my programming skills are pretty limited and I took over a (really small) existing C++ OOP project where I try to push my own stuff in. Unfortunately I'm experiencing a problem which goes beyond my knowledge and I hope to find some help here. I'm working with a third party library (which cannot be changed) for grabbing images from a camera and will use some placeholder names here. </p>

<p>The third party library has a function ""ThirdPartyGrab"" to start a continuous live grab and takes a pointer to a function which will be called every time a new frame arrives. So in a normal C application it goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>ThirdPartyGrab (HookFunction);
</code></pre>

<p>""HookFunction"" needs to be declared as: </p>

<pre><code>long _stdcall HookFunction (long, long, void*);
</code></pre>

<p>or ""BUF_HOOK_FUNCTION_PTR"" which is declared as</p>

<pre><code>typedef long (_stdcall *HOOK_FUNCTION_PTR) (long, long, void*);
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have a C++ application and a class ""MyFrameGrabber"" which should encapsulate everything I do. So I put in the hook function as a private member like this:</p>

<pre><code>long _stdcall HookFunction (long, long, void*);
</code></pre>

<p>Also there is a public void function ""StartGrab"" in my class which should start the Grab. Inside I try to call:</p>

<pre><code>ThirdPartyGrab (..., HookFunction, ...);
</code></pre>

<p>which (not surprisingly) fails. It says that the function call to MyFrameGrabber::HookFunction misses the argument list and I should try to use &amp;MyFrameGrabber::HookFunction to create a pointer instead. However passing ""&amp;MyFrameGrabber::HookFunction"" instead results in another error that this cannot be converted to BUF_HOOK_FUNCTION_PTR. </p>

<p>After reading through the <a href=""http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C++ FAQ function pointers</a> I think I understand the problem but can't make up a solution. I tried to make the hook function static but this also results in a conversion error. I also thought of putting the hook function outside of the class but I need to use class functions inside the hook function. Is there another way or do I need to change my whole concept? </p>

<p>EDIT 14.01.08:
I tested the singleton workaround since I cannot change the third party library and the void pointer is only for data that is used inside the hook function. Unfortunately it didn't worked out of the box like I hoped.... I don't know if the static function needs to be in a separate class so I put it in my ""MyFrameGrabber"" class:</p>

<pre><code>static MyFrameGrabber&amp; instance()
{
        static MyFrameGrabber _instance;
        return _instance;
}
long Hook(long, long, void*); // Implementation is in a separate cpp file
</code></pre>

<p>In my cpp file I have the call_hook function:</p>

<pre><code>long MFTYPE call_hook(long x, MIL_ID y, void MPTYPE *z)
{
    return MyFrameGrabber::instance().Hook(x,y,z);
}
void
MyFrameGrabber::grab ()
{
    ThirdPartyGrab(..., call_hook, ...);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this gives me an error in <code>static MatroxFrameGrabber _instance;</code> that no matching standard constructor is found. That's correct because my MyFrameGrabber constructor looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>MyFrameGrabber (void* x,
                const std::string &amp;y, int z,
                std::string &amp;zz);
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to put in an empty constructor <code>MyFrameGrabber();</code> but this results in a linker error. Should I pass empty parameters to the MyFrameGrabber constructor in the singleton? Or do I need to have a separate Hook Class and if yes how could I access MyFrameGrabber functions? Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>SECOND EDIT 15.01.08:
I applied the changes and it compiles and links now. Unfortunately I cannot test this at runtime yet because it's a DLL and I have no Debug Caller Exe yet and there are other problems during initialization etc. I will mark the post as answer because I'm sure this is the right way to do this.</p>

To help me get beyond the broad topic of ""active directory integration,"" what does it mean in your .NET app, both ASP.NET and WinForms?</p>

<p>Here are some sample changes I have to consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>When creating and managing users in your app, are administrators presented with a list of all AD users or just a group of AD users?</li>
<li>When creating new security groups within your app (we call them Departments, like ""Human Resources""), should this create new AD groups?</li>
<li>Do administrators assign users to security groups within your app or outside via AD? Does it matter?</li>
<li>Is the user signed on to your app by virtue of being signed on to Windows? If not, do you track users with your own user table and some kind of foreign key into AD? What foreign key do you use to link app users to AD users? Do you have to prove your login process protects user passwords?</li>
<li>What foreign key do you use to link app security groups to AD security groups?</li>
<li>If you have a WinForms component to your app (we have both ASP.NET and WinForms), do you use the Membership Provider in your WinForms app? Currently, our Membership and Role management predates the framework's version, so we do not use the Membership Provider.</li>
</ol>

<p>Am I missing any other areas of functional changes?</p>

<p><strong>Followup question</strong></p>

<p>Do apps that support ""active directory integration"" have the ability to authenticate users against more than one domain? Not that one user would authenticate to more than one domain but that different users of the same system would authenticate against different domains.</p>

<pre><code>md5(group_concat(some_column))

<p>The problem with this approach is:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's inefficient. It has to concat all of the values of the column as a string in some temporary storage before passing it to the md5 function</li>
<li>group_concat has a max length of 1024, after which everything else will be truncated.</li>
</ol>

<p>(In case you're wondering, you can ensure that the concat of the values is in a consistent order, however, as believe it or not group_concat() accepts an order by clause within it, e.g. <code>group_concat(some_column order by some_column)</code>)</p>

<p>MySQL offers the nonstandard bitwise aggregate functions BIT_AND(), BIT_OR() and BIT_XOR() which I presume would be useful for this problem. The column is numeric in this case but I would be interested to know if there was a way to do it with string columns.</p>

<p>I have run into HMAC SHA-1 digest problems with the ObjC code, so I'm putting that to the side and looking at existing, working Perl code, to try to troubleshoot digest creation.</p>

<p>I am testing HMAC SHA-1 digest output from the <code>s3ls</code> command of the <code>Net::Amazon::S3</code> package and comparing that against the <code>_encode</code> subroutine that I pulled out and put into its own perl script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w                                                                                                                                                                                    

use MIME::Base64 qw(encode_base64);
use Digest::HMAC_SHA1;
use String::Escape qw( printable unprintable );

sub _ascii_to_hex {
    (my $str = shift) =~ s/(.|\n)/sprintf(""%02lx"", ord $1)/eg;
    return $str;
}

sub _encode {
    my ( $aws_secret_access_key, $str ) = @_;
    print ""secret key hex: ""._ascii_to_hex($aws_secret_access_key).""\n"";
    my $hmac = Digest::HMAC_SHA1-&gt;new($aws_secret_access_key);
    $hmac-&gt;add($str);
    my $digest = $hmac-&gt;digest;
    print ""cleartext hex: ""._ascii_to_hex($str).""\n"";
    print ""digest hex: ""._ascii_to_hex($digest).""\n"";
    my $b64 = encode_base64( $digest, '' );
    print ""encoded: "".$b64.""\n"";
}

my $secret = ""abcd1234"";
my $cleartext = ""GET\n\n\nFri, 12 Dec 2008 10:08:51 GMT+00:00\n/"";
_encode($secret, $cleartext);
</code></pre>

<p>Here is sample output from this script:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./testhmac.pl 
secret key hex: 6162636431323334
cleartext hex: 4745540a0a0a4672692c2031322044656320323030382031303a30383a353120474d542b30303a30300a2f
digest hex: 63308f9b8a198440d6d8685a3f3f70d0aab02f68
encoded: YzCPm4oZhEDW2GhaPz9w0KqwL2g=
</code></pre>

<p>What I am testing is that, if I input the same secret key and cleartext into the same <code>_encode</code> function of the <code>Net::Amazon::S3</code> package, I should see the very same secret key, cleartext, and digest bytes.</p>

<p>Indeed, I get the same bytes for the secret key and cleartext.</p>

<p>But I get something different for the digest (and of course the base64 encoding), e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>$ s3ls --access-key=foobar --secret-key=abcd1234
...
secret key hex: 6162636431323334
cleartext hex: 4745540a0a0a4672692c2031322044656320323030382031303a30383a353120474d542b30303a30300a2f
digest hex: c0da50050c451847de7ed055c5286de584527a22
encoded: wNpQBQxFGEfeftBVxSht5YRSeiI=
</code></pre>

<p>I have verified that the secret key and clear text are the same input to both scripts. The encoding subroutine is virtually identical in both scripts (except for an unused argument passed to the subroutine, which I remove from my custom version).</p>

<p>What would cause the HMAC SHA-1 digest to be computed differently in both cases, if the input bytes and <code>_encode</code> subroutine are the same?</p>

Kinda weird, but OK, rules are rules.</p>

<p>So according to this calendar, we have these boundary values for 2008/2009</p>

<ul>
<li>28/12 is week 52</li>
<li>29/12 is week 1</li>
<li>1/1 is week 1</li>
<li>8/1 is week 2</li>
</ul>

<p>C# offers a GregorianCalendar class, that has a function <code>GetWeekOfYear(date, rule, firstDayOfWeek)</code>. </p>

<p>The parameter <code>rule</code> is an enumeration with 3 possible values: <code>FirstDay, FirstFourWeekDay, FirstFullWeek</code>. From what I've understood I should go for the <code>FirstFourWeekDay</code> rule, but I tried all of them just in case.</p>

<p>The last parameter informs which week day should be considered the first day of the week, according to that calendar it's Monday so Monday it is.</p>

<p>So I fired up a quick and dirty console app to test this:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Globalization;

namespace CalendarTest
{
    class Program

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {

            var firstWeekDay = DayOfWeek.Monday;
            var twentyEighth = new DateTime(2008, 12, 28);
            var twentyNinth = new DateTime(2008, 12, 29);
            var firstJan = new DateTime(2009, 1, 1);
            var eightJan = new DateTime(2009, 1, 8);
            PrintWeekDays(cal, twentyEighth, firstWeekDay);
            PrintWeekDays(cal, twentyNinth, firstWeekDay);
            PrintWeekDays(cal, firstJan, firstWeekDay);
            PrintWeekDays(cal, eightJan, firstWeekDay);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        private static void PrintWeekDays(Calendar cal, DateTime dt, DayOfWeek firstWeekDay)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Testing for "" + dt.ToShortDateString());
            Console.WriteLine(""--------------------------------------------"");
            Console.Write(CalendarWeekRule.FirstDay.ToString() + ""\t\t"");

            Console.Write(CalendarWeekRule.FirstFourDayWeek.ToString() + ""\t"");
            Console.WriteLine(cal.GetWeekOfYear(dt, CalendarWeekRule.FirstFourDayWeek, firstWeekDay));
            Console.Write(CalendarWeekRule.FirstFullWeek.ToString() + ""\t\t"");
            Console.WriteLine(cal.GetWeekOfYear(dt, CalendarWeekRule.FirstFullWeek, firstWeekDay));
            Console.WriteLine(""--------------------------------------------"");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>... and this what I get</p>

<p>So as we see, none of the combinations above matches the official calendar (if you are in a hurry, just see that 29/12 never gets week #1).</p>

<p>What am I getting wrong here? Maybe there's something glaring that I am missing? (it's Friday and late work hours here in Belgium, bear with me ;))</p>

<p>Edit: Maybe I should explain: what I need is a function that works for any year, returning the same results as the gregorian calendar I linked. So no special workarounds for 2008. </p>

#define THROW(type, error) (throw TemplateRadioException&lt;type&gt;(

</code></pre>

<p>So if I have to define a new exception, I can just define a empty class like this.</p>

<pre><code>class NuclearException {};
</code></pre>

<p>To throw exception</p>

<pre><code>THROW(NuclearException , ""Boom!!"");
</code></pre>

<p>To catch</p>

<pre><code>try {

} catch (TemplateException&lt;NuclearException&gt; &amp;e) {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we want to catch all exception, we can write this</p>

<pre><code>try {

} catch (Exception &amp;e) {
   // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>It works fine, but I don't sure are there any side effects? Is this a good idea to define different type of exception? Or there is better solution? I have no idea :S</p>

<p>Thanks.

<p>On an SQL Server 2005 called <strong>BHAVMSQL02</strong>, I have two databases <em>Mattercentre_dev</em> and <em>CMSNET_DEV</em>. The <em>Mattercentre_dev</em> has a stored procedure that builds a list from a table in <em>CMSNET_DEV</em>. The stored procedure looks 
like this...</p>

<pre><code>USE [Mattercentre_dev]
GO
/****** Object:  StoredProcedure [dbo].[UDSPRBHPRIMBUSTYPE]

SET @SQL =

PRINT @SQL

EXECUTE sp_executeSQL @SQL

@SERVERNAME == 'BHAVMSQL02'

@DBASE      == 'CMSNET_DEV'
</code></pre>

<p>When the stored procedure was executed the following error message appeared...</p>

<pre><code>The server principal ""ReadUser"" is not able to access the database ""CMSNET_DEV"" under the current security context.
</code></pre>

<p>After googling the error message, I carried out the following fix...</p>

<ul>
<li>Deleted the user ReadUser from
BHAVMSQL02 -> Databases ->
Mattercentre_dev -> Security -> Users</li>
<li><p>Set Up ReadUser from BHAVMSQL02 ->
Security -> Logins with the following
settings...</p>

<p>General<br>
Login Name - readUser<br>
Password - xxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
Confirm - xxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
Default db - master<br>
default lg - British English<br>
Everything Else - Unset  </p>

<p>Server Roles
Only Public Set</p>

<p>User Mappings

Database Role Membership - db_owner, public  </p>

<p>Mattercentre_dev - ReadUser - dbo<br>
Database Role Membership - db_owner, public </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I then ran the following script...</p>

<pre><code>ALTER DATABASE CMSNET_DEV SET TRUSTWORTHY ON
GO
ALTER DATABASE mattercentre_dev SET TRUSTWORTHY ON
GO
</code></pre>

<p>I re-ran the stored procedure and executed it again and I still have the same
error message.</p>

are similar to my own.</p>

Repository&lt;T&gt; lives in a separate project called DataAccess. According to <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.dotnet.framework.aspnet/browse_thread/thread/767f1a821d9b23da/b1e045958ae427a5?lnk=st#b1e045958ae427a5"" rel=""noreferrer"">this post from the MS newsgroups</a> (relevant part copied below):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internally, the ObjectDataSource is calling Type.GetType(string) to get the
  type, so we need to follow the guideline documented in Type.GetType on how
  to get type using generics. You can refer to MSDN Library on Type.GetType:</p>
  
  <p><a href=""http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w3f99sx1.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w3f99sx1.aspx</a></p>
  
  <p>From the document, you will learn that you need to use backtick (`) to
  denotes the type name which is using generics.</p>
  
  <p>Also, here we must specify the assembly name in the type name string.</p>
  
  <p>So, for your question, the answer is to use type name like follows:</p>
  
  <p>TypeName=""TestObjectDataSourceAssembly.MyDataHandler`1[System.String],TestObjectDataSourceAssembly""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, makes sense. When I try it, however, the page throws an exception:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:ObjectDataSource ID=""MyDataSource"" TypeName=""MyProject.Repository`1[MyProject.MessageCategory],DataAccess"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>[InvalidOperationException: The type specified in the TypeName property of ObjectDataSource 'MyDataSource' could not be found.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The curious thing is that this only happens when I'm viewing the page. When I open the ""Configure Data Source"" dialog from the VS2008 designer, it properly shows me the methods on my generic Repository class. Passing the TypeName string to Type.GetType() while debugging also returns a valid type. So what gives?</p>

<p>When developing a Drupal site however, much of the work is in ""setup"".  Besides the theme and modules you don't really have any ""source code"".  How do you run multiple instances of the same site so developers can all work at the same time yet share their work?</p>

<p>Example Scenario:</p>

<p>We launch an initial version of a Drupal site with content type ""X"" created.  We also initially launch a view on the site that lists all the nodes of type ""X"" in chronological order.  The client starts using the site, add content, menu items etc.</p>

<p>The next release is planned to add user search ability to that view.  The setup for that is contained in the database though.  We can copy down the production database to our development version to get the latest data while we work on changing the view.  During that time however the client can still be updating the site, making our dev database out of sync.  When we are ready to push the new view to production, is there an easier way to do it other than manually repeat the steps to set it up on the production install?</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a good, free bit-aware compressor that might work on such a stream? My main problem with the ""standard options"" is this stream should really be treated as bits, not bytes, else the structure is lost, and their overhead swamps any gain.</p>

<p>Addition:</p>

<p>The reason I want to compress these streams is because users are going to be cutting+pasting them, probably using something like base64 encoding, so saving some data is helpful.</p>

<p>Here is an example, for those who would like to see it. I'll add formatting to make it easier to read:</p>

<pre><code>110 110 - This is a 6x6 grid (the maximum is 7x7, so we only need 3 bits!)

000000
011110
010010
010010
011110
000000 - This is one layout grid

000000
000000
001000
000100
000000
000000 - This is the second layout grid
</code></pre>

<p>Now we list some pieces</p>

<pre><code>010 11111111 - A piece is a 3-bit colour code, then an 8-bit list of 'on / off' bits.
001 10101010 - Another bit!
001 10101010 - Another, identical bit!
</code></pre>

<p>The reason I say this should be considered 'as bits' is that there is obvious compression options when viewed as a bitstream (in particular, usually many 0s in the 'grid's), which disappear when you consider it as a byte-stream.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;views:QuestionView x:Name=""QuestionDataView"" /&gt;

QuestionViewModel qdata = new QuestionViewModel();
qdata.FetchQuestions();
QuestionDataView.DataContext = qdata.Questions;
</code></pre>

<p>In the WPF approach, we <strong>set the DataContext of the <em>Window</em> to the <em>ViewModel</em> itself</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;view:QuizView Margin=""4"" /&gt;

base.DataContext = new QuizViewModel(Quiz.Create());
</code></pre>

<p>It just seems that every MVVM example I look at does DataContext binding in a slightly new variation and I'm <strong>trying to nail down</strong> some solid ground as to ""<strong>how DataContext binding is done in the MVVM pattern</strong>"". </p>

<p>What goes through your head when you decide to bind the DataContext to something: why bind the DataContext of a <strong>Window / View / ListBox / etc.</strong> to a <strong>ObservableCollection / ModelView / etc.</strong>? What are the advantages, disadvantages, strategies here? </p>

<p>Any input appreciated.</p>

<p>Here's the closest that I have come:</p>

    xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""

    Width=""250"" Height=""300""&gt;
    &lt;Border BorderBrush=""Black"" BorderThickness=""2"" &gt;
      &lt;Controls:WrapPanel&gt; 
      &lt;TextBlock x:Name=""tb1"" TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;Short text. &lt;/TextBlock&gt;
      &lt;TextBlock x:Name=""tb2"" TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;A bit of text. &lt;/TextBlock&gt;
      &lt;TextBlock x:Name=""tb3"" TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;About half of a line of text.&lt;/TextBlock&gt;
      &lt;TextBlock x:Name=""tb4"" TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;More than half a line of longer text.&lt;/TextBlock&gt;
      &lt;TextBlock x:Name=""tb5"" TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;More than one line of text, so it will wrap onto the  following line.&lt;/TextBlock&gt;
      &lt;/Controls:WrapPanel&gt;
      &lt;/Border&gt;
&lt;/UserControl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But the issue is that although the text blocks tb1 and tb2 will go onto the same line because there is room enough for them completely, tb3 onwards will not start on the same line as the previous block, even though it will wrap onto following lines.</p>

<p>I want each text block to start where the previous one ends, on the same line. I want to put click event handlers on some of the text. I also want paragraph breaks. Essentially I'm trying to work around the lack of FlowDocument and Hyperlink controls in Silverlight 2.0's subset of XAML.</p>

<hr>

<p>To answer the questions posed in the answers:</p>

<p><strong>Why not use runs for the non-clickable Text?</strong> If I just use individual TextBlocks only on the clickable text, then those bits of text will still suffer from the wrapping problem illustrated above. And the TextBlock just before the link, and the TextBlock just after. Essentially all of it. It doesn't look like I have many opportunities for putting multiple runs in the same TextBlock.</p>

<p>Dividing the links from the other text with RegExs and loops is not the issue at all, the issue is display layout.</p>

<p><strong>Why not put each word in an individual TextBlock in a WrapPanel</strong> Aside from being an ugly hack, this does not play at all well with linebreaks - the layout is incorrect.</p>

<p>It would also make the underline style of linked text into a broken line.</p>

<p>Here's an example with each word in its own TextBlock. Try running it, note that the linebreak isn't shown in the right place at all.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl x:Class=""SilverlightApplication2.Page""
    xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""

    &lt;Controls:WrapPanel&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock  TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;Short1 &lt;/TextBlock&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock  TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;Longer1 &lt;/TextBlock&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock  TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;Longerest1 &lt;/TextBlock&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock  TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;
                &lt;Run&gt;Break&lt;/Run&gt;
                &lt;LineBreak&gt;&lt;/LineBreak&gt;
        &lt;/TextBlock&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock  TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;Short2&lt;/TextBlock&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock  TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;Longer2&lt;/TextBlock&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock  TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;Longerest2&lt;/TextBlock&gt;

        &lt;TextBlock  TextWrapping=""Wrap""&gt;Longerest3&lt;/TextBlock&gt;
    &lt;/Controls:WrapPanel&gt;
&lt;/UserControl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>What about The LinkLabelControl</strong> as <a href=""http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Silverlight-LinkLabel-control.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/SilverlightLinkLabel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. It has the same problems as the approach above, since it's much the same. Try running the sample, and make the link text longer and longer until it wraps. Note that the link starts on a new line, which it shouldn't. Make the link text even longer, so that the link text is longer than a line. Note that it doesn't wrap at all, it cuts off. This control doesn't handle line breaks and paragraph breaks either.</p>

<p><strong>Why not put the text all in runs, detect clicks on the containing TextBlock and work out which run was clicked</strong>
Runs do not have mouse events, but the containing TextBlock does. I can't find a way to check if the run is under the mouse (IsMouseOver is not present in Silverlight) or to find the bounding geometry of the run (no clip property).</p>

<p>There is <strong>VisualTreeHelper.FindElementsInHostCoordinates()</strong></p>

<p>The code below uses VisualTreeHelper.FindElementsInHostCoordinates to get the controls under the click. The output lists the TextBlock but not the Run, since a Run is not a UiElement.</p>

<pre><code>private void theText_MouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, System.Windows.Input.MouseButtonEventArgs e)
{
    // get the elements under the click
    UIElement uiElementSender = sender as UIElement;
    Point clickPos = e.GetPosition(uiElementSender);
    var UiElementsUnderClick = VisualTreeHelper.FindElementsInHostCoordinates(clickPos, uiElementSender);

    // show the controls
    string outputText = """";
    foreach (var uiElement in UiElementsUnderClick)
    {
        outputText += uiElement.GetType().ToString() + ""\n"";
    }
    this.outText.Text = outputText;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Use an empty text block with a margin to space following content onto a following line</strong></p>

<p>I'm still thinking about this one.
How do you calculate the right width for a line-breaking block to force following content onto the following line? Too short and the following content will still be on the same line, at the right. Too long and the ""linebreak"" will be on the following line, with content after it. You would have to resize the breaks when the control is resized.</p>

<p>Some of the code for this is:</p>

<pre><code>    TextBlock lineBreak = new TextBlock();
    lineBreak.TextWrapping = TextWrapping.Wrap;
    lineBreak.Text = "" "";
    // need adaptive width 
    lineBreak.Margin = new Thickness(0, 0, 200, 0);

"500637","1","","","2009-02-01 11:30:49","","39","5270","<p>This might be a naive question. I'm currently learning the Spring framework and <i>dependency injection</i>. While the basic principle of DI is rather easy to grasp, it's not immediately obvious why you need an elaborate framework to implement it.</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Saw
{
    public abstract void cut(String wood);
}

public class HandSaw extends Saw
{
    public void cut(String wood)
    {
        // chop it up
    }
}

public class ChainSaw extends Saw
{
    public void cut(String wood)
    {
        // chop it a lot faster
    }
}

public class SawMill
{
    private Saw saw;

    public void setSaw(Saw saw)
    {
        this.saw = saw;
    }

    public void run(String wood)
    {
        saw.cut(""some wood"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you could simply do:</p>

<pre><code>Saw saw = new HandSaw();
SawMill sawMill = new SawMill();
sawMill.setSaw(saw);
sawMill.run();
</code></pre>

<p>Which would be equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""saw"" class=""HandSaw""/&gt;

&lt;bean id=""sawMill"" class=""SawMill""&gt;
   &lt;property name=""saw"" ref=""saw""/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>plus:</p>

<pre><code>ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(""sawmill.xml"");
SawMill springSawMill = (SawMill)context.getBean(""sawMill"");
springSawMill.run();
</code></pre>

<p>Granted, this is a contrieved example, and with more complex object relationships it might be more efficient to stash up an XML file than writing it programmatically, but surely there must be more to it than that?</p>

<p>(I know the Spring framework is more than that, but I'm thinking of the need for a DI container.)</p>

<p>In the first example it would also be trivial to change dependencies midstream:</p>

<pre><code>// gotta chop it faster
saw = new ChainSaw();
sawMill.setSaw(saw);
sawMill.run();
</code></pre>

<p>I have coded additional functions which would allow user to interact with this data (like adding/deleting nodes, swapping nodes, etc...)</p>

<p>Currently this plugin supports that whenever you want to add any node, you can call following method,</p>

<pre><code>$(""#browser"").treeview({
     add: branches
});
</code></pre>

<p>here <code>branches</code> is <code>jQuery object</code> created with the HTML block, which would represent a particular node.</p>

<p>However, for delete and swapping of nodes, I use common JQuery functions like,</p>

<p><strong>for delete,</strong></p>

<pre><code>$(""#topnd2"").remove();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>for swapping,</strong></p>

<pre><code>var next = $(""#topnd2"").next();
$(""#topnd2"").insertAfter(next);
</code></pre>

<p><code>topnd2</code> is an <code>id</code> of any particular tree node.</p>

<p>The nodes get deleted / swapped properly but the problem is the tree does not get rendered and therefore the tree images (mainly vertical lines denoting branches) are not set properly.</p>

<p>For example, if I delete the last node then that node will be removed from rendered treeview but the remaining sibling node should get L as branch line image but not | .</p>

<p>I tried calling </p>

<p><code>$(""#browser"").treeview();</code> </p>

<p>Please let me know your ideas.</p>

<p>The database instance and Visual Studio are located on the same machine. This works fine in returning data to the web api while within development and debugging mode.

<p>I need help getting the published web api to connect to my SQL Server database from outside the development Visual Studio setup.</p>

<p>The last thing I can think of is that maybe I am incorrect in how I understand the connection string. If the web api uses the connection string to connect to the database from the server-side then it should work just fine like it does when in development calling to <code>http://localhost:port#</code> since it's all on the same machine. But, if the database string needs to be based on a client-side call then it would have to be with domain names and IP addresses.
Can someone tell me which one it is?</p>

<p>The only thing else that comes to mind is that there is something I am not doing, and need to do, inside of IIS Manager. I see connect string there as well but unsure what that is for our does since the connection string is inside the application. Also maybe I am suppose to give the app some kind of authorization to communicate with the database server even though they are on the same machine???</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  Thanks for the clarification.  I had always thought this was an OS thing (since processes never seem to decrease in size in UNIX-like systems, but do in windows).</p>

The same app on other servers does not exhibit this behavior. This happens on WebSphere and Tomcat.  The environment is tricky to set up so it is difficult to try to do something like profiling within Eclipse.</p>

<p>Is there a way to profile (or some other method of inspecting) an existing Java app running in Tomcat to find out what methods are being executed while it's in this spinwait kind of state?  The app is only executing one method when it gets in this state (vendor's method). Vendor can't replicate the behavior (of course).</p>

<hr>

<p>Update:  </p>

<p>Using JConsole I was able to determine who was running and what they were doing.  It took me a few hours to then figure out why it was doing it.  The problem ended up being that the vendor's API jar that was being used did not match exactly to the the database configuration that it was using.  It was defaulting to having tracing and performance monitoring enabled on the servers that had the slight mis-match in configuration.  I used a different jar and all is well.</p>

<p>So thanks, Joshua, for your answer. JConsole was extremely easy to setup and use to monitor an existing application. </p>

<p>@Cringe - I did some experimenting with some of the options you suggested.  I had some problems with getting JProfiler set up, it looks good (but pricey).  Going forward I went ahead and added the Eclipse Profiler plugin and I'll be looking over the different open source profilers to compare functionality.</p>

 context db = new context();
 db.TableName.Attach(updatedRecord,true);

<p>When I run this code I get the following exception: <code>System.Data.Linq.ChangeConflictException: Row not found or changed.

I'd like to be able to halt the animation at it's current state when the user taps the screen, but I'm unable to do so.</p>

<p>I can halt the animation easily enough by calling</p>

<pre><code>[view.layer removeAnimationForKey:kFrameAnimationKey];

<p>The problem is that neither the view's frame not it's layer's position are updated directly by the animation. If I look at the position property at the time the animation starts and when it ends in</p>

<pre><code>- (void)animationDidStop:(CAAnimation *)animation finished:(BOOL)finished

<p>it has not changed.</p>

<p>It seems that you need to do that explicitly when the animation stops. But if the animation stops at some arbitrary point, you don't know how far it's gone. So the question is either how to make the animation update the layer's position property as it goes, or how to know how far the animation has gone when it's been stopped.</p>

<p>The problem is that when I call the <code>DSOFramer's OPEN</code> function, if I have Excel open in another window, it closes the Excel document (but leaves Excel running).  If the document it tries to close has unsaved data, I get a dialog boxclosing Excel doc in another window. If unsaved data in file, <code>dsoframer</code> fails to open with a messagebox: <code>Attempt to access invalid address</code>.  </p>

<p>I built the source, and stepped through, and its making a call in its <code>CDsoDocObject::CreateFromFile</code> function, calling <code>BindToObject</code> on an object of class IMoniker.  The <code>HR</code> is <code>0x8001010a</code> <code>The message filter indicated that the application is busy</code>.  On that failure, it tries to <code>InstantiateDocObjectServer</code> by <code>classid</code> of <code>CLSID</code> Microsoft Excel Worksheet... this fails with an <code>HRESULT</code> of <code>0x80040154</code> <code>Class not registered</code>.  The <code>InstantiateDocObjectServer</code> just calls <code>CoCreateInstance</code> on the <code>classid</code>, first with <code>CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER</code>, then (if that fails) with <code>CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER</code>.</p>

<p>I know <code>DSOFramer</code> is a popular sample project for embedding Office apps in various dialog and forms.  I'm hoping someone else has had this problem and might have some insight on how I can solve this.  I really don't want it to close any other open Excel documents, and I really don't want it to error-out if it can't close the document due to unsaved data.</p>

<p>Update 1: I've tried changing the <code>classid</code> that's passed in to <code>Excel.Application</code> (I know that class will resolve), but that didn't work.  In <code>CDsoDocObject</code>, it tries to open key <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{00024500-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\DocObject</code>, but fails.  I've visually confirmed that the key is not present in my registry; The key is present for the guide, but there's no <code>DocObject</code> subkey.  It then produces an error message box: <code>The associated COM server does not support ActiveX document embedding</code>.  I get similar (different key, of course) results when I try to use the <code>Excel.Workbook programid</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2: I tried starting a 2nd instance of Excel, hoping that my automation would bind to it (being the most recently invoked) instead of the problem Excel instance, but it didn't seem to do that.  Results were the same.  My problem seems to have boiled down to this:  I'm calling the <code>BindToObject</code> on an object of class <code>IMoniker</code>, and receiving <code>0x8001010A (RPC_E_SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER)</code> <code>The message filter indicated that the application is busy</code>.  I've tried playing with the flags passed to the <code>BindToObject</code> (via the <code>SetBindOptions</code>), but nothing seems to make any difference.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update 3: It first tries to bind using an IMoniker class. If that fails, it calls <code>CoCreateInstance</code> for the <code>clsid</code> as a <code>fallback</code> method. This may work for other MS Office objects, but when it's Excel, the class is for the Worksheet. I modified the sample to <code>CoCreateInstance _Application</code>, then got the workbooks, then called the <code>Workbooks::Open</code> for the target file, which returns a Worksheet object. I then returned that pointer and merged back with the original sample code path. All working now.</strong></p>

As always I'm trying to follow best practices in setting up the project; I'm going to be using .NET 3.5, with the database being on Windows Server 2003/SQL Server 2005.</p>

<p>While I'm developing and testing the solution, should I have everything in my main project?  What I mean is... Visual Studio 2008 Professional lets you have ""database projects"" as well as all of the other types of projects.  For this application I'm going to need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Database Project containing the create and test scripts for the new data schema</li>
<li>C# projects containing the actual code/application:

<ol>
<li>Customer-facing web site(s) using ASP.NET MVC</li>
<li>Back-end order processing system, probably web-based but possibly a ""smart client""</li>
</ol></li>
<li>SSIS project containing packages to ETL the ""live"" application data provided by our vendor(s) and migrate over existing customer and order data from the legacy database.</li>
<li>Reporting project for SQL Server Reporting Services</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, I am wondering if it's a good idea to have all of these as part of one massive Visual Studio solution (let's call it ""EnterpriseSolution""), or if I should break them out and tackle them separately.  Most of the books and websites I've looked at include them all together, but they also assume a team of developers, DBAs, architects and the like - in this case I'm all of them rolled into one.  The database project and at least some ETL processes need to be done and loaded into production before the rest of the application is written, since we need to load the new vendor's products in a live environment (to start selling them).</p>

<p>I'm a little overwhelmed as to how I should begin to structure this, but I want to come up with an overall plan before I begin to lay things out and start coding.</p>

<li>Make a new project that #imports the remaining libraries. Make that build first. #Include the .tlh files it creates in all the places that #imported previously.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm curious if anyone has <strong>any other suggestions?</strong> Also, on the <strong>last point</strong> (making a new project and using #import only there) - if you did something like this, <strong>how did you do it?</strong> What type of project, what did the ""source"" look like, where did you output files?

<p>On a large project, we have a table of configuration options like these:</p>

<pre><code>Name         Value
----         -----
FOO_ENABLED  Y
BAR_ENABLED  N
...
</code></pre>

<p>(Hundreds of them).</p>

<p>The common practice is to call a generic function to test an option like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (config_options.value('FOO_ENABLED') == 'Y') ...
</code></pre>

<p>(Of course, this same option may need to be checked in many places in the system code.)</p>

<p>When adding a new option, I was considering adding a function to hide the ""magic string"" like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (config_options.foo_enabled()) ...
</code></pre>

<p>However, colleagues thought I'd gone overboard and objected to doing this, preferring the hard-coding because:</p>

<ul>
<li>That's what we normally do</li>
<li>It makes it easier to see what's going on when debugging the code</li>
</ul>

<p>The trouble is, I can see their point!  Realistically, we are never going to rename the options for any reason, so about the only advantage I can think of for my function is that the compiler would catch any typo like fo_enabled(), but not 'FO_ENABLED'.</p>

<p>What do you think?  Have I missed any other advantages/disadvantages?</p>

<p>For example, when computing the length, it may not be identical to the number of bytes - how is this supposed to be handled? Reading the standard, I'm probably fine using a <code>char</code> array for storage, but I'll still need to write functions like <code>strlen</code> etc. on my own, which work on encoded text, cause as far as I understand the problem, the standard routines are either ASCII only, or expect wide literals (16bit or more), which are not recommended by the unicode standard. So far, the best source I found about the encoding stuff is a post on <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Joel's on Software</a>, but it does not explain what we poor C++ developer should use :)</p>

<p>This doesn't work because defining a singleton method via ""def"" is not a closure, so I get an exception that ""msg"" is an undefined variable or method.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is something like using the ""define_method"" method in the Module class, but as far as I can tell, this can only be used to define a method on a class... but I want a Singleton Method...</p>

<p>So, I would love to write it something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def define_say(obj, msg)
  obj.define_singleton_method(:say) {
    puts msg
  }
end
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone know how I can achieve this without having to create a method to store a Proc and then use the Proc within a singleton method? (basically, I want a clean, non-hacky way of doing this)</p>

<p>Is this possible?</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>To clarify, I have an update panel in one user control, the other update panels are in other user controls, so they can't see each other unless I were to expose some custom properties and use findControl etc etc...</p>

<p>Edit Again:</p>

<p>Here is what I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>public void Update()
{
    recursiveUpdate(this); 
}

private void recursiveUpdate(Control control)
{
    foreach (Control c in control.Controls)
    {
        if (c is UpdatePanel)
        {
            ((UpdatePanel)c).Update();
        }

        if (c.HasControls())
        {
            recursiveUpdate(c);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I had 3 main user controls that were full of update panels, these controls were visible to the main page, so I added an Update method there that called Update on those three.</p>

<p>In my triggering control, I just cast this.Page into the currentpage and called Update.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>AARRGGGG!</p>

<p>While the update panels refresh, it does not call Page_Load within the subcontrols in them...What do I do now!</p>

<p><em>Each time a UIActionSheet is displayed, I alloc an instance of UIActionSheet to  one of the class variables, set the display properties, display it, and release it</em>.</p>

<p>This works smoothly, at first. The problem is that after running for a while, eventually both UIActionSheet pointers (class variables actionSheet1 &amp; actionSheet2 in the code example above) will end up pointing to the same memory, depending on what happens at runtime, thereby causing both if statements in the delegate method to evaluate true. Not good.</p>

<p>Now, if I were to alloc each UIActionSheet only once per run and hold on to the memory (never call release), this should not happen. But I am trying to be conservative here. Does Apple intend for the delegate to be used in this way?</p>

The specifics of the OS itself are irrelevant if I can't get multi-tasking, memory management, and other basic things up and running, so I need to work on that first. I've some questinos about designing a malloc routine.</p>

<p>I figure that malloc() is either going to be a part of the kernel itself (I'm leaning towards this) or a part of the program, but I'm going to have to write my own implementation of the C standard library either way, so I get to write a malloc. My question is actually rather simple in this regard, how does C (or C++) manage its heap?</p>

<p>What I've always been taught in theorey classes is that the heap is an ever expanding piece of memory, starting at a specified address, and in a lot of senses behaving like a stack. In this way, I know that variables declared in global scope are at the beginning, and more variables are ""pushed"" onto the heap as they are declared in their respective scopes, and variables that go out of scope are simply left in memory space, but that space is marked as free so the heap can expand more if it needs to.</p>

<p>What I need to know is, how on earth does C actually handle a dynamically expanding heap in this manner? Does a compiled C program make its own calls to a malloc routine and handle its own heap, or do I need to provide it with an automatically expanding space? Also, how does the C program know where the heap begins?</p>

<p>Oh, and I know that the same concepts apply to other languages, but I would like any examples to be in C/C++ because I'm most comfortable with that language. I also would like to not worry about other things such as the stack, as I think I'm able to handle things like this on my own.</p>

<p>So I suppose my real question is, other than malloc/free (which handles getting and freeing pages for itself, etc) does a program need the OS to provide anything else?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em> I'm more interested in how C uses malloc in relation with the heap than in the actual workings of the malloc routine itself. If it helps, I'm doing this on x86, but C is cross compiler so it shouldn't matter. ^_^</p>

<p>EDIT FURTHER: I understand that I may be getting terms confused. I was taught that the ""heap"" was where the program stored things like global/local variables. I'm used to dealing with a ""stack"" in assembly programming, and I just realized that I probably mean that instead. A little research on my part shows that ""heap"" is more commonly used to refer to the total memory that a program has allocated for itself, or, the total number (and order) of pages of memory the OS has provided.</p>

<p>So, with that in mind, how do I deal with an ever expanding <em>stack</em>? (it does appear that my C theory class was mildly... flawed.)</p>

<p>My experience with floating point variables has always involved 4-byte multiples, like singles (32 bit), doubles (64 bit), and long doubles (which I've seen refered to as either 96-bit or 128-bit). That's why I was a bit confused when I came across an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_precision"" rel=""noreferrer"">80-bit extended precision data type</a> while I was working on some code to read and write to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Interchange_File_Format"" rel=""noreferrer"">AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) files</a>: an extended precision variable was chosen to store the sampling rate of the audio track.</p>

<p>When I skimmed through Wikipedia, I found the link above along with a brief mention of 80-bit formats in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985"" rel=""noreferrer"">IEEE 754-1985 standard</a> summary (but not in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754"" rel=""noreferrer"">IEEE 754-2008 standard</a> summary). It appears that on certain architectures ""extended"" and ""long double"" are synonymous.</p>

<p>One thing I haven't come across are specific applications that make use of extended precision data types (except for, of course, AIFF file sampling rates). This led me to wonder:</p>

<ul>
<li>Has anyone come across a situation where extended precision was necessary/beneficial for some programming application?</li>
<li>What are the benefits of an 80-bit floating point number, other than the obvious ""it's a little more precision than a double but fewer bytes than most implementations of a long double""?</li>
<li>Is its applicability waning?</li>

<p>auto-hide, pinning, and moving of pages by drag-and-drop are all features we'd like to use.</p>

<p>the built-in delphi docking doesn't seem to be full-featured enough to do the things we need (also see sample below).  perhaps i should dig deeper into delphi's docking abilities...my initial impression is that they seem very toolbar-oriented rather than something i can drop a frame into.</p>

<p>i'm not experienced at docking topics.  my only experience has been with the DevExpress docking library where i needed to programmatically create &amp; dock panels.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f8REv.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f8REv.gif"" alt=""screenshot""></a></p>

<p>is it my imagination or are DevExpress's products unduly difficult to use/learn?  the DevExpress Ribbon Bar component compared to the d2009 Ribbon Bar was certainly a useful experience.  i will migrate to the d2009 Ribbon Bar as soon as convenient to do so.  it was refreshingly straight-forward to learn and use.  a sharp contrast compared to the DevExpress equivalent.  if it takes 4x as longer to make it using the DevExpress equivalent, it's time to change direction.</p>

<p>Update: Here's why I wanted this to work:</p>

<p>I'm trying to make an app that uses a dictionary kinda like a database. I wanted the functionality of this psuedocode to function:</p>

<pre><code>dict_1={}
dict_2={}
dict_3={}

dict_1[""FooBar1.avi""]=[movie_duration,movie_type,comments]
dict_2[""FooBar2.avi""]=[movie_duration,movie_type,comments]
dict_3[""FooBar3.avi""]=[movie_duration,movie_type,comments]

dict_database[SomeUniqueIdentifier1]=dict_1
dict_database[SomeUniqueIdentifier2]=dict_2
dict_database[SomeUniqueIdentifier3]=dict_3
</code></pre>

<p>SomeUniqueIdentifier# would be a unique value that I'm using as a database key/unqiueID to look up entries.</p>

<p>I want to be able to update the ""comments"" field of FooBar1.avi by:</p>

<pre><code>WhichDict= dict_database[SomeUniqueIdentifier1]
WhichDict[WhichDict.keys()[0]][2]='newcomment'
</code></pre>

<p>instead of having to do:</p>

<pre><code>dict_database['SomeUniqueIdentifier1'][dict_database['SomeUniqueIdentifier1'].keys()[0]][2]='newcomment'
</code></pre>

<p>I guess the best way to describe it would be: like ""Guitar Hero"", but with no canned tracks. All original music--composed by you, on the fly--but the software would use its knowledge of music theory (as well as some supervised learning algorithms) to make sure that your input gets turned into something that sounds great.</p>

<p>It sounds a little silly, explaining it like that, but there ya go. It's something I think would make an interesting side project.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'm looking for a Java library for generating the actual audio. Browsing around on sourceforge, there are countless software synths, and I have no idea which to choose.</p>

<p>My top priority is that it should sound incredible... Really rich, layered, textured synths, with gobs of configurable parameters. Emulation of acoustic instruments is not important to me.</p>

<p>My second priority is that it ought to be straightforward to use strictly as a library, with no GUI involved at all. (If there's a synth with really breathtaking output, but it's tightly-coupled with a GUI, then I might consider ripping the audio portion out of the application, but I'd rather start with a nicely contained library).</p>

<p>I know I could send MIDI to a standalone synth, but I think it'd be cool to read the actual synth code and learn a little DSP while I'm at it.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Do you know of a tool that supports this? Or do you know of a parser which pairs the javascript to something I can use inside the html browser?</p>

I'm trying to get my calculator to let me enter a number then click an operator (+, -, x, /), enter another number then hit an operator again and have the display update and be able to keep this going.</p>

<p>The following is the code I'm using when you hit an operator.  By default wait is set to false.  After running through the class once, value1 is stored and wait is set to true and that works fine.  From there it doesn't seem to work quite right:</p>

            }

            // Determine operation to be performed

<p>Since the user has to interact with the image directly, I need to be able to convert the PictureBox click coordinates to image coordinates.</p>

<p>What I have done so far, is compare the aspect ratio of the PictureBox to the aspect ratio of the image. For example, if the PictureBox is ""more widescreen"" in relation to the image (see screenshot), it means the PictureBox will stretch the image to its own height and center it horizontally, showing its background color (in this case red) to the left and right of the image. Then I assume the image's displayed height is the same as PictureBox.Height, and work from there.</p>

<p>There's a problem, though. As you can see in the screenshot (green annotation mine), the white image being stretched to fit (zoomed) inside the red PictureBox leaves a small margin at the bottom.</p>

<p><a href=""http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/3541/bordernl6.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">screenie http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/3541/bordernl6.th.png Click for full-size.</a></p>

<p>This doesn't happen for all PictureBox.Size / Image.Size combinations, though. This leads me to believe there must be a better way to do this.</p>

<hr>

<p>Sure, I'll do that. I just have to adapt the code to remove the context dependency.</p>

<p>But the margin at the bottom does not come from my code. It comes from the PictureBox itself. Do me a favor and try the following:</p>

<p>Add a PictureBox (PictureBox1) to a Form, dock it to all four sides of the Form. The code should look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Public Class Form1

    Private Sub Form1_Shown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Shown

        PictureBox1.SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.Zoom

        PictureBox1.BackColor = Color.Red
        PictureBox1.Image = New Bitmap(PictureBox1.Width, PictureBox1.Height)
        Dim g As Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(PictureBox1.Image)

        g.FillRectangle(Brushes.White, 0, 0, PictureBox1.Image.Width, PictureBox1.Image.Height)

    End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>Run it and resize the Form so that the image is stretched (zoomed) to fill the height of the PictureBox, leaving red bars to the left and right of the white square. Now resize the Form vertically, as slow as you can. You should see a red margin at the bottom every now and then.</p>

<p>The same thing happens with the width and a horizontal resize, showing a margin to the right.</p>

<p>It's because of this small imperfection that I know the zoom factor cannot be calculated the way I have been doing it; the result would only be an approximate. If after trying this you still think the code is relevant, then I'll gladly post it.</p>

<p>The problem with this, of course, is that the user can't tell anything is happening until the service starts, and because of the hardware we're using that can take up to a minute.  So I'm thinking of throwing in a ""Loading / Please Wait"" indicator of some sort.  The thing is, our project is nearing lockdown and a change as big as making a new class would cause a lot of headaches -- modifying an existing file (like Program.cs) is a lot less intrusive than making a new one.  Long story short: is there a .NET class that would be well suited to being displayed (asynchronously, I guess) before I start plinking at the SQL Server, then removed when it starts to respond?</p>

I understand that this means that the objects state should not change after it has been created. This is kind of a new way of thinking for me, but it makes sense in many cases.</p>

<p>Ok, so I start creating immutable value-objects. </p>

<ul>
<li>I make sure they take the entire state as parameters to the constructor, </li>
<li>I don't add property setters, </li>
<li>and make sure no methods are allowed to modify the content (only return new instances).</li>
</ul>

<p>But now I want to create this value object that will contain 8 different numeric values. If I create a constructor having 8 numeric parameters I feel that it will not be very easy to use, or rather - it will be easy to make a mistake when passing in the numbers. This can't be good design.</p>

<p><em>So the questions is:</em> Are there any other ways of making my immutable object better.., any magic that can be done in C# to overcome a long parameter list in the constructor? I'm very interested in hearing your ideas..</p>

<p>I am using WPF to animate canvases, and I am using the <code>BeginAnimation</code> method to translate (move) a canvas across another canvas.</p>

<p>With the BeginAnimation, I need to specify the <code>From</code> and <code>To</code> coordinates for both x and y, and this is the method I am using this like such:</p>

<pre><code>//X 
Animator_Body_X.From = Translate_Body.X; //Current x-coordinate
Animator_Body_X.To = //The end X-coordinate
Translate_Body.BeginAnimation(TranslateTransform.XProperty, Animator_Body_X);

//Y
Animator_Body_Y.From = Translate_Body.Y; //Current y-coordinate
Animator_Body_Y.To = //The end Y-coordinate
Translate_Body.BeginAnimation(TranslateTransform.YProperty, Animator_Body_Y);
</code></pre>

<p>Now the canvas needs to be translated using a given angle, which I have available from the method.</p>

<p>So my question is, <strong>given the angle (0-359) the canvas is currently rotated at, starting x and y coordinates (of where the canvas is currently situated) and distance (in px), how do I calculate to end coordinates?</strong> ie to where the canvas will finally be translated to.</p>

<p><a href=""http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/4794/canvastranspositionmi5.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">alt text http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/4794/canvastranspositionmi5.jpg</a></p>

<p>In the above image, I have drawn an example of what I want to achieve.</p>

<p>Suppose the canvas (solid-border box) has a current heading (angle) of 130 degrees, and it needs to be translated (following a path down that angle; ie depending on where it is currently facing) by 200 pixels...what will be the new coordinates (where it will stop animating: dashed-border box) of the canvas? How do I calculate these new coordinates of where it will stop?</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE] Solution:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to the help of both <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/534424/math-in-wpf-getting-new-x-y-coordinates-after-a-translation/534475#534475"">Andy</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/534424/math-in-wpf-getting-new-x-y-coordinates-after-a-translation/534628#534628"">Cameron</a>, it is finally working as intended.  </p>

<p>And here is the working code:</p>

<pre><code>double headingRadians = Heading * (Math.PI / 180);

Animator_Body_X.From = Translate_Body.X;
Animator_Body_X.To = Math.Sin(headingRadians) * pix + Translate_Body.X;
Translate_Body.BeginAnimation(TranslateTransform.XProperty, Animator_Body_X);

Animator_Body_Y.From = Translate_Body.Y;
Animator_Body_Y.To = ((Math.Cos(headingRadians) * pix) * -1) + Translate_Body.Y;
Translate_Body.BeginAnimation(TranslateTransform.YProperty, Animator_Body_Y);

The mainframe makes a nightly dump into sql server, such that each of our clients has it's own database in the server.   There are a few other databases in the server instance as well, plus some older client dbs with no data.</p>

<p>We often need to run reports or check data across all clients.  I would like to be able to run queries using sp_msforeachdb or something similar, but I'm not sure how I can go about filtering unwanted dbs from the list.  Any thoughts on how this could work?  </p>

<p>We're still on SQL Server 2000, but should be moving to 2005 in a few months.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
I think I did a poor job asking this question, so I'm gonna clarify my goals and then post the solution I ended up using.</p>

<p>What I want to accomplish here is to make it easy for programmers working on queries for use in their programs to write the query using one client database, and then pretty much instantly run (test) code designed and built on one client's db on all 50 or so client dbs, with little to no modification.</p>

<p>With that in mind, here's my code as it currently sits in Management Studio (partially obfuscated):</p>

<pre><code>use [master]
declare @sql varchar(3900) 

set @sql = 'complicated sql command added here'

-----------------------------------
declare @cmd1 varchar(100)
declare @cmd2 varchar(4000)
declare @cmd3 varchar(100)
set @cmd1 = 'if ''?'' like ''commonprefix_%'' raiserror (''Starting ?'', 0, 1) with nowait'
set @cmd3 = 'if ''?'' like ''commonprefix_%'' print ''Finished ?'''
set @cmd2 = 
    replace('if ''?'' like ''commonprefix_%'' 
    begin 
        use [?]
        {0} 
    end', '{0}', @sql)

exec sp_msforeachdb @command1 = @cmd1, @command2 = @cmd2, @command3 = @cmd3
</code></pre>

<p>The nice thing about this is all you have to do is set the @sql variable to your query text.  Very easy to turn into a stored procedure.  It's dynamic sql, but again: it's only used for development (famous last words ;) ).  The downside is that you still need to escape single quotes used in the query and much of the time you'll end up putting an extra <code>''?'' As ClientDB</code> column in the select list, but otherwise it works well enough.  </p>

<p>Unless I get another really good idea today I want to turn this into a stored procedure and also put together a version as a table-valued function using a temp table to put all the results in one resultset (for select queries only).</p>

<pre><code>public JsonResult JoinMailingList(string txtEmail)
{
        // ...

       return new JsonResult()
       {
           Data = new { foo = ""123"", success = true }
       };
}
</code></pre>

<p>However (at least according to my first impression) this really isn't a good separation of concerns.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit test methods are harder to write becasue they don't have nice strongly typed data to test and have to know how to interpret the Json.</li>
<li>Its harder for some other View in future that isn't over HTTP (or any remote protocol involving serialization) to be 'plugged in' because its unnecessary in such cases to be serializing and deserializing the response.</li>
<li>What if you have TWO different places that need the results of that action? One wants Json and another wants XML or perhaps a fully <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/227624/asp-net-mvc-controller-actions-that-return-json-or-partial-html"">or partially</a> rendered view.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm wondering why the translation between an object and Json wasn't implemented declaratively via an attribute. In the code below you're essentially telling MVC that <code>this method is convertible to Json</code>, and then if it is called from an AJAX client a check is made for the attribute the <code>new JsonResult()</code> conversion performed internally.</p>

<p>Unit testing can just take the action result (<code>ObjectActionResult</code>) and pull out the strongly typed <code>Foo</code>.</p>

<pre><code>[JsonConvertible]
public ActionResult JoinMailingList(string txtEmail)
{
        // ...

       return new ObjectActionResult()
       {
           Data = new Foo(123, true)
       };
}
</code></pre>

<p>I was just curious as to people's thoughts and any alternative pattern to follow.</p>

<p>These are also just my initial observations - there are probably more reasons why this is not an ideal design (and probably plenty why its a perfectly acceptable and practical one!) I'm just feeling theoretical and devils-advocatey tonight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;* <em>Disclaimer:</em> I haven't even begun to think about how the attribute would be implemented or what sideeffects or repurcussions etc. it might have. </p>

<p>We are using a Scrum process to develop the software, albeit tailored to fit with our team and environment, and this is working quite well.  We're coming to the end of a sprint and the software is at a stage where the product owner wants to deploy it.</p>

<p>Previously, i.e. before Scrum, we would have deployed the software.  Now I feel like we have developed the software, we've passed all the user-defined/agreed release tests and demonstrated the software to the PO with a simulator, <b>we have achieved our goals</b>.  We are ready to provide deployment support but I don't think it should be our responsibilty to deploy.</p>

<p>What are other peoples experiences?  Should the dev team do the deployment or should we just hand over the completed software to the PO and provide support?</p>

<p><b>Summing up</b></p>

<p>A lot of great responses, thanks.  The question may seem like I'm trying to squirm out of work or responsibility, maybe I am a little ;o)  What I'm more interested in is other peoples processes.  The problem we face here is that if the dev team deploy the software then we end up providing 24/7 support to production for the software.  No prob, except there are only two of us.  So, to allow us to get back to developing software rather than providing support all the time I thought it might be helpful to get the ""IT"" team involved in development process.  Hopefully this will get the 'buy-in' and then allow them to deploy and provide first level support.  We also have a plant in Mexico and its difficult for the dev team to go and deploy there, it makes more sense for the local support to do it, with guidance/advice from the developers.</p>

<p>Just to let you know, the IT engineers did deploy the software, with guidance/advice from dev.  Its gone quite well, the customer is happy - he's got increased value for his software, and isn't that what its all about?</p>

<hr>

<p>First question, if I have a custom xml namespace say ""<a href=""http://mydomain/mynamespace"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://mydomain/mynamespace</a>"" do I have to add a</p>

<pre><code>[XmlRoot(Namespace = ""http://mydomain/mynamespace"")]
</code></pre>

<p>to every class in my library. Or is there a way to define this namespace as default for the whole assembly?</p>

<hr>

<p>Second question, is there a reason behind the always added namespaces</p>

<pre><code>xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""
</code></pre>

<p>even if there is no actual reference to any of the namespaces? I just feel they add noise to the resulting xml. Is there a way to remove them an only have the custom namespace in the resulting xml?</p>

<hr>

<p>Third question, are there tools to support the generation of schema definitions (e.g. for all public [Serializable] classes of an assembly) and the validation of xml against specific schemas available?</p>

<p>If there are, would you recommend XML Schema from W3C or RELAX NG?</p>

The main problem I am having is when I create a UserControl for example a simple one which shows an object different colours - I have successfully created a property for this and can assign the colours to this UserControl at Design Time and it works - shows Green, Red etc.<br>
However when I give this UserControl a name so I can assign this Property at Runtime I get an error ""Could not create instance of type 'MyUserControl'"" if I remove the name the user control works - I can add as many as I want at Design Time and they all work but as soon as I assign a Name or x:Name it breaks and I cannot figure out why.<br>
It is possible to create a Label for example and it has a name I can refer to it in code - why not my own control - no matter how simple.</p>

<p>My main problems are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why does giving my UserControl a
Name or x:name stop it from working?</li>
<li>How to use multiple
UserControls of the same type on a
Window?</li>
<li>How to access the Canvas, Label
etc of a UserControl from inside or
outside the UserControl?</li>
<li>How to instance a UserControl at
runtime or at design time in code or XAML?</li>

Specifically, I'm working on an app to track animal breeding.  Each animal has an ID; it's also got a sire ID and a dame ID.  So it's possible to have a one to many from the sire or dame to its offspring.  I would be inclined to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
SIRE_ID INT 
DAME_ID INT
</code></pre>

<p>and record a null value for those animals which were purchased and added to the breeding stock and an ID in the table for the rest.  </p>

<p>So:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can someone point me to an
article/web page that discusses
modeling this sort of relationship?</li>
<li>Should the ID be an INT or some sort
of String?  A NULL in the INT would
indicate that the animal has no
parents in the database but a String
with special flag values could be
used to indicate the same thing.</li>
<li><p>Would this possibly be best modeled
via two tables?  I mean one table
for the animals   and a separate
table solely indicating kinship e. g.:</p>

<p>Animal</p>

<p>ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY</p>

<p>Kinship</p>

<p>ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY</p>

<p>SIRE_ID INT PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY</p>

<li>Last Name</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Address</li>

<p>All fields are optional, the last field should search over all the other fields.
I go over every field and see if it's IsNullOrEmpty(). If it's not, I would like to append a part of my query so it adds the relevant search part.<br>
First name and last name should be exact matches and have more weight then the other fields. Age is a string and should exact match. Address can varry in order. Everything can also varry in order.</p>

This table has a huge problem with duplicate data in the table caused by invalid input from various parties over the years. I need to output a list of duplicate records so I can begin the long process of cleaning them up.</p>

<p>So consider the following table structure:</p>

<pre><code>Table Company(   
  CompanyId NVarChar(10) Not Null Constraint PK_Locations Primary Key,   
  CompanyName NVarChar(30),   
  CompanyAddress NVarChar(30),   
  CompanyCity NVarchar(30), 
  CompanyState Char(2),   
  CompanyZip NVarChar(10),   
  DateCreated DateTime, 
  LastModified DateTime,  
  LastModifiedUser NVarChar(64) 
)
</code></pre>

<p>For the first parse I'm not even going to worry about typos and variations of spelling yet which is going to be a greater nightmare down the road that I haven't even got the first clue about solving yet.</p>

<p>So for this part a record is considered to be duplicate when multiple records match on the following conditions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(CompanyName Or CompanyAddress) And CompanyCity And CompanyState</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zip is excluded because so many of the locations are missing zip/postal codes and so many are entered incorrectly that it just makes for a far less accurate report if I include them.</p>

<p>I realize that there may legitimately be multiple locations for a company within a single city/state [for instance McDonalds, just off the top of my head], and there may legitimately be multple companies at a single address within a city and state [for instance inside a shopping mall or office building], but for now we will consider that these at least warrant some level of human attention and will include them in the report.</p>

<p>Matches on single fields are a piece of cake, but I'm coming unstuck when I get to multiple fields, especially when some are conditional.</p>

<p>My primary development environment will be Microsoft, Visual Studio 2008 (and support of older Visual Studio 6 code as well).  SQL Server 2005, 2008 as well as legacy support of SQL Server 2000.  Microsoft Office 2003, potential to install 2007 but support as far back as Office 2000.  The software I will wrote and support will be Windows XP mostly, but some Vista.  I am going to have to assume there are 64-bit implementations out there to install to.</p>

<p>My first confusion begins with choosing AMD or Intel.  My concern is that there is a compatibility issue with building software using Visual Studio in an AMD environment.  I dont have any evidence, its just a concern that hopefully someone will clear up for me.</p>

<p>Last, I am confused about 32-bit and 64-bit installations.  Should I stick with the least common denominator (32-bit) even though 64-bit is steadily gaining ground?  I am aware that the 64-bit operating systems will address over 4G of RAM and that I like because I would like to set up as many Virtual Machines for test environments as possible, and may have many active at once..</p>

<p>I am not looking for the dream machine, just a machine with a monitor and the best processor for about $1000 that will allow me to write software for the majority of machines out there.</p>

This makes textual diffing and merging of project file changes basically impossible. Changing one compiler setting can make my visual diff tool think I've changed 50% of the lines in the file!

<p>Our problem is that we are building a complex (as in, many objects refer to each other) stateful RIA system. It seems as Hibernate is designed to be used mainly on one-off applications - JSF and the like.</p>

<p>The problem is mainly that of lazy loading. Since there can be several HTTP requests between the initialization and actually loading lazy collections, a session per transaction is out of the question. A long-lived session (one per application) doesn't work well either, because once a transaction hits a snag and throws an exception, the whole session is invalidated, thus the lazy loaded objects break. Then there's all kinds of stuff that just don't work for us (like implicit data persisting of data from outside an initialized transaction).</p>

<p>My poor explanations aside, the bottom line is that Hibernate does magic we don't like. It seems like TopLink isn't any better, it also being written on top of EJB.</p>

<p>So, a stateless persistence layer (or even bright-enough object-oriented database abstraction layer) is what we would need the most.</p>

<p>Any thoughts, or am I asking for something that doesn't exist?</p>

<pre><code>[TestClass]

<p>Ideally, I'd like to specify this behavior for only a small subset of my unit tests so that I don't have to pay the penalty of a new AppDomain creation for tests that don't care about global state (the vast majority of my tests).</p>

To me they always represented some ""magic"" that was going to happen on the database side, far far away from the control of my application code. I also wanted to limit the amount of work the DB had to do, as it's generally a shared resource and I always assumed triggers could get to be expensive in high load scenarios.</p>

<p>That said, I have found a couple of instances where triggers have made sense to use (at least in my opinion they made sense). Recently though, I found myself in a situation where I sometimes might need to ""bypass"" the trigger. I felt really guilty about having to look for ways to do this, and I still think that a better database design would alleviate the need for this bypassing. Unfortunately this DB is used by mulitple applications, some of which are maintained by a very uncooperative development team who would scream about schema changes, so I was stuck.</p>

<p>What's the general consesus out there about triggers? Love em? Hate em? Think they serve a purpose in some scenarios?

<p>[Edit] The leaves can also be names (i.e. variables), so relying on their properties as integers is not an option. The trees do represent sums.</p>

<p>[Edit2] The point of this excercise is to reduce a sum by finding terms of the form <em>A</em> and <em>-A</em>, swizzling the tree to get them into a subtree (+ <em>A</em> <em>-A</em>) in order to eliminate them. The three operations above are axioms in my system and they need to be used all the way, otherwise it's not possible to prove that the reduced tree is equal to the original. Since I'm using <a href=""http://twelf.plparty.org/wiki/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Twelf</a> logic programming language, if I can figure out an algorithm to do what I originally asked, the rest follows easily, but alternative solutions are of course welcome.</p>

<p>I doubt that hardware is the issue as I'm running on the latest Quad core Intel chip, with 4GB RAM and a WD Velociraptor 10,000rpm hard disk. And part of what's odd is that the EXE doesn't seem to be using much CPU (1-5%) and doesn't seem to be doing an awful lot of I/O either.</p>

<p>So... is this a known issue? Why is it so slow? And is there any way to speed it up?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To clarify a couple of things people have answered about, I am not talking about the compilation of code within Visual Studio. We're using web application projects already, and the speed of compilation of those is not the issue. The problem is the pre-compilation of the site <em>after</em> these projects have already been compiled (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229863.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">see this MSDN page for more details</a>) as part of the dev build script.

Basically, a long running client service (on several machines) establish a duplex connection to the server over a netTcpBinding. The server then uses the callback contract of the client to perform certain on-demand oparations, to which the client responds in an asynchronous fashion (fairly standard stuff I think). I subclass the DuplexClientBase class to handle most of the communication.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when something goes wrong on either end (such as a network failure, unexpected exception, etc), the channel gets faulted/aborted and all subsequent operations fail. I've gotten around this limitation in non-duplex channels by creating a RecoveringClientBase class that automatically picks up when the client has faulted and retries the operation.</p>

<p>So my question is, is there an established way of determining when a duplex channel has faulted? Where should I check this, on the server or the client? Failing that, what options do I have to ensure that the connection gets re-established?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'm looking for some advice specific to duplex channels, where the server might try to use a callback channel that was faulted. Thus, I need something that will immediately reconnect/resubscribe when something happens to the channel. At the moment I'm listening to the channel's Closing event and recreating it if the state is anything but Closed. It sort of works, but it feels hacky...</p>

<p><strong>Update: Post-mortem and workaround</strong></p>

<p>Dommer's probably right, that it's the <code>Normalization</code> property in the <code>XmlTextReader</code> that's giving me problems.  The thing is (as you can see from the comments) I found it pretty much impossible to go from a <code>(SqlCommand).ExecuteXmlReader()</code> to anything that will let me go near the <code>Normalization</code> property of an <code>XmlTextReader</code>.  Oftentimes the Microsoft documentation on this was contradictory or just plain wrong.</p>

<p>So I settled on a workaround.  If I simply use an <code>SqlDataReader</code> to soak up the output everything is fine.  The XML looks perfect and parses quite nicely.</p>

<pre><code>StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
using(SqlDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader())
{
    while(rdr.Read())
        sb.Append((string)rdr[0]);
}

Related to this very specific sort of application a I two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Experienced guys in Delphi and/or COM, do you have any workrounds to work with the buggy TLB interface ? 
Some of the bugs are: IDE crashing during edition of a large TLB, lost of methods IDs, TLB corruption, etc.
Here, we haven't found any good solution. Actually we tried do upgrade do the new 2007 version. But the new IDE TLB interface has the same bugs that we found before.</p></li>
<li><p>How do you control TLBs versions ? The TLB file is in a binary format and conflict resolutions are very hard to do. We tried to do it exporting the interfaces descriptions to IDL and commiting into CVS, but we didn't found any good way to generate TLBs from IDL using Delphi. Additionaly, the MIDL tool provided by Microsoft, didn't parse correctly the IDL files that we exported from delphi.</p></li>

<p>I would like to execute the inserts and updates to the auditing tables outside of the transaction I am executing, so that the auditing will occur anyway, even if the transaction rolls back.

<p>The ui-icon-wrench id is added automatically, it's for testing only for now, i try 
to traverse the dom, and get the id of the object element from there. The object element 
also generated automatically using swfobject, u can see to code above ..

The classes and interfaces I deal with daily are: Struts Actions, Struts ActionForms, Value Objects, Service Interfaces and Implementations, DAO Interfaces and Implementations, and Entities. I'm pretty clear on the how and why of most of these, except I'm unsure about the correct separation of responsibilities between the ActionForms, Value Objects, and Entities. I should also mention that the Domain Model (i.e. all of the entities) doesn't contain much (if any) real business logic. This is essentially a CRUD app and most of the real logic is in the database (yuck!). Anyway, there are several distinct Java related issues that I'm wondering about:</p>

<p>1) It seems there is not much difference between the Entities and the Value Objects (VOs), and a lot of code must be written to transform on into the other when they pass through the service layer in either direction (Struts Actions deal only with VOs, DAOs deal only with Entities). So, VOs and Entities seem somewhat redundant. Why have them both?</p>

<p>2) Where should the VO&lt;->Entity translation code go? The service layer, the Entity, the VO?</p>

<p>3) VOs are placed directly into ActionForms and directly bound to tags in the JSP (e.g. ). Is this a good practice? If not, what's the appropriate design?</p>

<p>4) It is unclear how to properly handle foreign key dependencies in the Value Objects. For example, certain VOs have a type field that, in database terms, represent a foreign key relationship into a type table. In the UI, this translates into a dropdown field that lets the user pick the type, OR a label that simply displays the textual representation of the type (depending on which screen it is). Now, should the VO have a property for the type ID, the textual representation of the type, or both? Who is responsible for translating between the two, and when?</p>

<p>5) The VOs have a field for their database ID. I thought VOs don't have identities? What's up with this?</p>

<p>I hope these questions are generic enough to be of general interest. It seems this would come up all the time in this type of architecture.</p>

<p>Also, I have the suspicion that this architecture is way to heavy for this app, and if you have suggestions about a better one, go ahead. But I'm mainly interested in the answer to the above questions since a different architecture is a long-term refactoring that I can't do right now.</p>

<p>I am writting a logging class where the goal is to be able to do this:</p>

<pre><code>// thread one
Logger() &lt;&lt; ""Some string"" &lt;&lt; std::ios::hex &lt;&lt; 45;
// thread two
Logger() &lt;&lt; L""Some wide string"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>Currently my Logger header looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#pragma once;
#include &lt;ostream&gt;    
class Logger
{
public:
    Logger();
    ~Logger();

    std::ostream* out_stream;
};

template &lt;typename T&gt;
Logger&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (Logger&amp; logger, T thing) {
    *logger.out_stream &lt;&lt; thing;
    return logger;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some notes about this class:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cross platform compatibility is not an issue.</li>
<li>Inside of Logger.cpp there is a singleton class that takes care of creating the ""real"" ostream.</li>
<li>The Logger constructor and deconstructor perform the necessary locking of the singleton.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have three problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I make the operator&lt;&lt; function a friend or member so I can set out_stream as private? </li>
<li>How do I make the operator&lt;&lt; function work for manipulators?</li>
<li>How can I add a specialization so that if T is a WCHAR* or std::wstring that it will convert it to char* or std::string before passing it to out_stream?  (I can do the conversion. Losing high unicode characters isn't a problem in my case.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary of things learned in answers:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Put template  BEFORE friend instead of after.</li>
<li>std::ios::hex is not a manipulator.  std::hex is a manipulator.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>End Result</strong></p>

<pre><code>#pragma once
#include &lt;ostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

std::string ConvertWstringToString(std::wstring wstr);

class Logger
{
public:
    Logger();
    ~Logger();

    template &lt;typename T&gt;
    Logger&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (T data) {
        *out &lt;&lt; data;
        return *this;
    }
    Logger&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (std::wstring data) {
        return *this &lt;&lt; ConvertWstringToString(data);
    }
    Logger&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (const wchar_t* data) {
        std::wstring str(data);

The problem I recently discovered is that it doesn't support nested transactions: if a transaction is started inside an another transaction, then every SQLs running in the context of the inner transaction will be executed using the same db connection, and when it's commited or rolled back it will automatically commit or roll back all the changes starting from the outer transaction.</p>

<p>As far as I understand I can implement the support for nested transaction using JDBC 3.0 savepoints: whenever a nested transaction is started, I can set a new savepoint for the current connection. Afterward, if the nested transaction is rolled back, I will just rollback to this savepoint. If, on the other hand, it is commited, I will just do nothing. Only the commit of the most outer transaction will save the changes to the db.</p>

<p>Is this correct? Does this approach have any flaws? If yes, what are my possibilities?</p>

<p>That bit is fine, a quick google pointed me towards the correct settings to add to wrapper.conf to enable this.  There were entries already in wrapper.conf, so I copy/pasted the last entry and modified it:</p>

<pre><code>wrapper.java.additional.8=""-Djava.endorsed.dirs=C:/Program Files/OurApp/tomcat/common/endorsed""
wrapper.java.additional.8.stripquotes=TRUE
wrapper.java.additional.9=""-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=9135,suspend=n""
wrapper.java.additional.9.stripquotes=TRUE

<p>It didn't work, because the quotes are around everything, and the stripquotes only applies to linux systems.  </p>

<p>Theoretically the correct entries should be:</p>

<pre><code>wrapper.java.additional.8=-Djava.endorsed.dirs=""C:/Program Files/OurApp/tomcat/common/endorsed""
wrapper.java.additional.8.stripquotes=TRUE
wrapper.java.additional.9=-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=9135,suspend=n

<p>The second example doesn't need quotes - no spaces to break it up.
The first example does - because of ""Program Files""
Am I correct in this assessment?</p>

<p>If so, how/why is the application working as is?  There are several parameters ostensibly being set like this (nested in qutoes), which I believe actually have no effect.<br>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Devin's answer is basically what I understood to be the case. I should have mentioned that I'm using the .NET framework. So I wondered if there is perhaps a .NET library which would be able to be handle a docx file for printing? I see when adding a job to the <code>DefaultPrinterQueue</code> on a <code>LocalPrintServer</code> (in the <code>System.Printing</code> namespace) it can handle an XPS document. So perhaps this is the way to go.</p>

When clustering this information is periodically broadcast to other servers in the cluster to keep things in sync. You can use a database store to make sessions persistant but this information is only written periodically as well and is only really used for failure-recovery rather than actually replacing the in-memory sessions.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use sticky sessions (our configuration doesn't allow it unfortunately) this raises the problem of the sessions getting out of sync.</p>

<p>In other languages, web frameworks tend to allow you to use a database as the primary session store. Whilst this introduces a potential scaling issue it does make session management very straightforward.

<pre><code>/browse/&lt;name1&gt;/&lt;value1&gt;/&lt;name2&gt;/&lt;value2&gt;/ .... etc ....
</code></pre>

<p>where 'name' maps to a model attribute and 'value' is the search criteria for that attribute.  Each ""name"" will be treated like a category to return subsets of the model instances where the categories match.</p>

<p>Now, this could be handled with GET parameters, but I prefer more readable URLs for both the user's sake and the search engines.  These URLs subsets will be embedded on each page that displays this model, so it seems worth the effort to make pretty URLs.</p>

<p>Ideally each name/value pair will be passed to the view function as a parameter named <code>name1</code>, <code>name2</code>, etc.  However, I don't believe it's possible to defined named patterns via a regex's matched text.  Am I wrong there?</p>

<p>So, it seems I need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^browse/(?:([\w]+)/([\w]+)/)+$', 'app.views.view', name=""model_browse""),
)
</code></pre>

<p>It seems this should match any sets of two name/value pairs.  While it matches it successfully, it only passes the last name/value pair as parameters to the view function.  My guess is that each match is overwriting the previous match.  Under the guess that the containing (?:...)+ is causing it, I tried a simple repeating pattern instead:</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^browse/([\w]+/)+$', 'app.views.view', name=""model_browse""),
)

<p>... and got the same problem, but this time <code>*args</code> only includes the last matched pattern.</p>

<p>Is this a limitation of Django's url dispatcher, and/or Python's regex support?  It seems either of these methods should work.  Is there a way to achieve this without hardcoding each possible model attribute in the URL as an optional (.*) pattern?</p>

<p>Using reflection how can I invoke the DoSomething Method? </p>

<p>Reason I ask is because I store the method names in XML and dynamically create the UI. For example I'm dynamically creating a button and telling it what method to call via reflection when the button is clicked. In some cases it would be DoSomething or in others it would be DoSomethingElse.</p>

<p>I just don't know how to make it work as a JUnit test.</p>

<p>Currently, I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyInterfaceTest {

    @BeforeClass public static void setUpBeforeClass() throws Exception {
                // put your implementation here:

    @Test public void test2() { /* uses theImplementationToTest */ }    
}

<p>I use the static method <code>setUpBeforeClass</code> because the initialization of each implementation takes a lot of time, so I want to initialize it once for all tests.</p>

<p>With this version of the test, implementors have to change the code of <code>setUpBeforeClass</code> and put their own implementation. </p>

<p>I am sure that there is another way to write <code>MyInterfaceTest</code>, so that implementors will only have to inherit it or send it a parameter, and not change the code. However, I am not experienced enough in JUnit to make it work. Can you please show me how to do this?</p>

At the moment I control them via COM from a Python script using the latest version of the pywin32 product. Unfortunately COM seems to have a number of annoying drawbacks:</p>

<p>For example, the slightest upset seems to be able to break the connection to the COM-Server, once severed there seems to be no safe way to re-connect to the Excel application. There's absolutely no safety built into the COM Application object.</p>

<p>The Excel COM interface will not allow me to safely remote-control two seperate instances of the Excel application operating on the same workbook file, even if they are read-only.</p>

<p>Also when something does go wrong I seldom get any useful error-messages... at best I can except a numerical error-code or a barely useful message such as ""An Exception has occurred"". It's almost impossible to know why something went wrong.</p>

<p>Finally, COM lacks the ability to control some of the most fundamental aspects of Excel? For example there's no way to do a guaranteed close of just the Excel process that a COM client is connected to. You cannot even use COM to find Excel's PID.</p>

<p><strong>So what if I were to completely abandon COM?</strong> Is there an alternative way to control Excel? </p>

<p>All I want to do is run macros, open and close workbooks and read and write cell-ranges? Perhaps some .NET experts know a trick or two which have not yet bubbled into the Python community? What about you office-hackers? Could there be a better way to get at Excel's innards than COM?</p>

<p>In our last <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/583689/dictionaryt-of-listt-and-listviews-in-asp-net"">adventure</a>, I was attempting to properly show a <code>Dictionary&lt;Foo, Bar&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>.  Thanks to the helpful answers in that post, I realize I had been going about it in the wrong way.  </p>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>In today's adventure, I've been trying to get two specific properties from the <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> in the last question to display.  Each List has specific properties, shown below:</p>

<pre>
---------------------
|     Bar Class     |
---------------------
| Id        int     |
| Foo.Id    int     |
| Name      string  |
| Type      string  |
---------------------
</pre>

<p>For display, I'd like to display the <code>Bar.Name + Bar.Type</code>, concatenated together.  Obviously I have to retain the complete object, since the Id will be passed back to be sent to the database.</p>

<p>At first, I tried <code>&lt;%#Eval(""Value.Type"" + ""Value.Name"")%&gt;</code>, clearly that did not work.  My guess now is that I need to write a foreach loop to iterate through the Dictionary Object, and retrieve the <code>Dictionary.Value</code> Objects intact, and build a dropdown list out of that. But then, the problem becomes tying that back to the associated profile, and sending it back to the database wholesale.</p>

<p>Here currently is how the page looks:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=""center""&gt; &lt;%#Eval(""Key.Name"") %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;asp:DropDownList ID=""ddlListOfBars"" runat=""server"" 
DataSource='&lt;%#Eval(""Value"")%&gt;' DataValueField=""Id"" DataTextField=""Type"" /&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've been monkeying around with different ways of changing the <code>DataTextField</code> but haven't yet figured out a combination that works.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Am I overthinking this?</li>
<li>What am I missing?</li>
<li>Is there a resource for how you would pull specific properties out of the <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> to use those values as the display Values for the <code>DropDownList</code>, and if so, is there a good resource on that topic?</li>
<li>Is this post as clear as mud?</li>

<pre><code>Outlook.MailItem objMail = (Outlook.MailItem)olkApp.CreateItem(Outlook.OlItemType.olMailItem);
objMail.To = to;
objMail.Subject = subject;
objMail.HTMLBody = htmlBody;
</code></pre>

<p>The email is generated externally by saving from an RTF control (TX Text Control), which yields HTML with links to images stored in a <code>&lt;&lt;FileName&gt;&gt;</code>_files subdirectory. Example: </p>

<p><code>&lt;img border=""0"" src=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/ItsMe/Local%20Settings/Temp/2/zbt4dmvs_Images/zbt4dmvs_1.png"" width=""94"" height=""94"" alt=""[image]""&gt;</code></p>

<p>Sending the email this way generates a mail with broken links.  </p>

<p>Using Outlook 2007 as the email client with Word as the email editor, switching to RTF (Options tab, Format tab group) preserves the layout <em>and</em> inlines the images.</p>

<p>Programmatically doing this via:</p>

<pre><code>var oldFormat = objMail.BodyFormat;
objMail.BodyFormat = Outlook.OlBodyFormat.olFormatRichText;
objMail.BodyFormat = oldFormat;
</code></pre>

<p>loses the formatting and mangles the images (the image becomes a <code>[image]</code> link marker on screen which is clickable but no longer shows the image).  This isn't a surprise given that the documentation for <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb207134.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MailItem.BodyFormat Property</a> says ""<em>All text formatting will be lost when the <code>BodyFormat</code> property is switched from RTF to HTML and vice-versa</em>"".</p>

<p>Sadly there doesnt seem to be an easy way to change the <code>Type</code> of each <code>Attachment</code> in the <code>MailItem.Attachements</code> to <code>OlAttachmentType.olByValue</code>, as it's a read-only property that's set when you create the <code>Attachment</code>.</p>

<p>An approach that comes to mind is to walk the HTML, replacing the <code><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></code> tags with markers and programatically walking the <code>MailItem</code> text, inserting an <code>Outlook.Attachment</code> of <code>Type</code> <code>OlAttachmentType.olByValue</code>.</p>

<p>Another option is to convert the <code><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></code> links to use <code><code>src=""cid:uniqueIdN""</code></code> and add the images as attachments with the referenced identities.</p>

<p>So, to the question... Is there a way to get the linked images converted to embedded images, ideally without getting into third party tools like Redemption?  Converting to RTF happens to yield the outcome, but doing it that way is by no means a pre-requisite, and obviously may lose fidelity - I Just Want It to Just Work :D  Neither of my existing ideas sound Clean to me.</p>

<p>A while ago, I stumbled upon this 2001 DDJ article by Alexandrescu: 
<a href=""http://www.ddj.com/cpp/184403799"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.ddj.com/cpp/184403799</a></p>

<p>It's about comparing various ways to initialized a buffer to some value. Like what ""memset"" does for single-byte values. He compared various implementations (memcpy, explicit ""for"" loop, duff's device) and did not really find the best candidate across all dataset sizes and all compilers.</p>

<p>Quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a very deep, and sad, realization underlying all this. We are in 2001, the year of the Spatial Odyssey. (...) Just step out of the box and look at us — after 50 years, we're still not terribly good at filling and copying memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<ol>
<li>does anyone have more recent information about this problem ? Do recent GCC and Visual C++ implementations perform significantly better than 7 years ago ?

<li>I'm writing code that has a lifetime of 5+ (probably 10+) years and that will process arrays' sizes from a few bytes to hundred of megabytes. I can't assume that my choices now will still be optimal in 5 years. What should I do:
<ul>
   <li>a) use the system's memset (or equivalent) and forget about optimal performance or assume the runtime and compiler will handle this for me.
   <li>b) benchmark once and for all on various array sizes and compilers and switch at runtime between several routines.
   <li>c) run the benchmark at program initialization and switch at runtime based on accurate (?) data.
</ul>
</ol>

<p>Edit: I'm working on image processing software. My array items are PODs and every millisecond counts !</p>

<p>Edit 2: Thanks for the first answers, here are some additional informations:<ul><li>Buffer initialization may represent 20%-40% of total runtime of some algorithms. <li>The platform may vary in the next 5+ years, although it will stay in the ""fastest CPU money can buy from DELL"" category. Compilers will be some form of GCC and Visual C++. No embedded stuff or exotic architectures on the radar<li>I'd like to hear from people who had to update their software when MMX and SSE appeared, since I'll have to do the same when ""SSE2015"" becomes available... :)

<p>Here's a few refining details:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the query is set to filter on any
of those fields (such as getting a
list of non-disabled accounts in the
Marketing department group), they
disappear from the result set (since
as far as AD is concerned, they're
missing). </p></li>
<li><p>If the query is performed
with a highly-privileged domain
admin account, the query works just
fine.</p></li>
<li><p>The records with the problem is about 1/4 - 1/3 of the total user records.  Most <em>do</em> seem to be newer records (we thought for a time that it was perhaps related to upgrading to 2003 on the domain controller server), although some older records seem affected as well.</p></li>
<li><p>A cursory look over two similar records, one whose entire record is viewable by any account, and another which isn't doesn't show any obvious differences.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So my best guess is that there's some sort of permission deny set (perhaps at the schema level?) which makes certain fields restricted. I should note that the domain administrators never knowingly set any such permissions. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE/RESOLUTION:</strong> ADSI Edit (in <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/892777"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windows 2003 Support Tools</a>) helped me to nail it down to a change in the default permissions on the Authenticated User role.  For some people, the role contained the Read Account Restrictions (which contains userAccountControl) and Read Group Membership (memberOf), and for others it didn't.</p>

<p>The original cause of the difference still isn't clear, although the fact that most of the ""bad"" records were created <em>after</em> a switch to Windows 2003 for the Domain Controller, that could be a factor.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong>  This is still a bit undecided, but will most likely be an updated Group Policy, combined with a script to update existing accounts.</p>

<p>I've currently got a sizable test suite written using Selenium RC's C# driver. Running the entire test suite takes a little over an hour to complete. I normally don't have to run the entire suite so it hasn't been a concern up to now, but it's something that I'd like to be able to do more regularly (ie, as part of an automated build)</p>

<p>I've been spending some time recently poking around with the Selenium Grid project whose purpose essentially is to allow those tests to run in parallel. Unfortunately, it seems that the TestDriven.net plugin that I'm using runs the tests serially (ie, one after another). I'm assuming that NUnit would execute the tests in a similar fashion, although I haven't actually tested this out. </p>

<p>I've noticed that the NUnit 2.5 betas are starting to talk about running tests in parallel with pNUnit, but I haven't really familiarized myself enough with the project to know for sure whether this would work. </p>

<p>Another option I'm considering is separating my test suite into different libraries which would let me run a test from each library concurrently, but I'd like to avoid that if possible since I'm not convinced this is a valid reason for splitting up the test suite.</p>

<p>You have two tables on the back end: one is Components and one is Manufacturers.  Every Component has ONE Manufacturer.  Not at all an unusual, foreign key lookup-relationship.</p>

<p>I Silverlight, I access data via WCF service.  I will make a call to Components_Get(id) to get the Current component (to view or edit) and a call to Manufacturers_GetAll() to get the complete list of manufacturers to populate the possible selections for a ComboBox.  I then Bind the SelectedItem on the ComboBox to the Manufacturer for the Current Component and the ItemSource on the ComboBox to the list of possible Manufacturers.  like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl.Resources&gt;
    &lt;data:WebServiceDataManager x:Key=""WebService"" /&gt;
&lt;/UserControl.Resources&gt;
&lt;Grid DataContext={Binding Components.Current, mode=OneWay, Source={StaticResource WebService}}&gt;
    &lt;ComboBox Grid.Row=""2"" Grid.Column=""2"" Style=""{StaticResource ComboBoxStyle}"" Margin=""3""
              ItemsSource=""{Binding Manufacturers.All, Mode=OneWay, Source={StaticResource WebService}}"" 
              SelectedItem=""{Binding Manufacturer, Mode=TwoWay}""  &gt;
        &lt;ComboBox.ItemTemplate&gt;
            &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
                &lt;Grid&gt;
                    &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding Name}"" Style=""{StaticResource DefaultTextStyle}""/&gt;
                &lt;/Grid&gt;
            &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
        &lt;/ComboBox.ItemTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/ComboBox&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This worked great for the longest time, until I got clever and did a little client side caching of the Component (which I planned turn on for the Manufacturers as well).  When I turned on caching for the Component and I got a cache hit, all of the data would be there in the objects correctly, but the SelectedItem would fail to Bind.  The reason for this, is that the calls are Asynchronous in Silverlight and with the benefit of the caching, the Component is not being returned prior to the Manufacturers.  So when the SelectedItem tries to find the Components.Current.Manufacturer in the ItemsSource list, it is not there, because this list is still empty because Manufacturers.All has not loaded from the WCF service yet.  Again, if I turn off the Component caching, it works again, but it feels WRONG - like I am just getting lucky that the timing is working out. The correct fix IMHO is for MS to fix the ComboBox/ ItemsControl control to understand that this WILL happen with Asynch calls being the norm.  But until then, I need a need a way yo fix it...</p>

<p>Here are some options that I have thought of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Eliminate the caching or turn it on across the board to once again mask the problem. Not Good IMHO, because this will fail again.  Not really willing to sweep it back under the rug.</li>
<li>Create an intermediary object that would do the synchronization for me (that should be done in the ItemsControl itself).  It would accept and Item and an ItemsList and then output and ItemWithItemsList property when both have a arrived.  I would Bind the ComboBox to the resulting output so that it would never get one item before the other.  My problem is that this seems like a pain but it will make certain that the race condition does not re-occur.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any thougnts/Comments?</p>

<p>FWIW: I will post my solution here for the benefit of others.</p>

<p>@Joe:  Thanks so much for the response.  I am aware of the need to update the UI only from the UI thread.  It is my understanding and I think I have confirmed this through the debugger that in SL2, that the code generated by the the Service Reference takes care of this for you.  i.e. when I call Manufacturers_GetAll_Asynch(), I get the Result through the Manufacturers_GetAll_Completed event. If you look inside the Service Reference code that is generated, it ensures that the *Completed event handler is called from the UI thread. My problem is not this, it is that I make two different calls (one for the manufacturers list and one for the component that references an id of a manufacturer) and then Bind both of these results to a single ComboBox.  They both Bind on the UI thread, the problem is that if the list does not get there before the selection, the selection is ignored.</p>

<p>Also note that this is still a problem <a href=""http://brantob.wordpress.com/2008/10/09/silverlight-2-combo-box-binding-sublety/"" rel=""noreferrer"">if you just set the ItemSource and the SelectedItem in the wrong order</a>!!! </p>

<p>Another Update:
While there is still the combobox race condition, I discovered something else interesting.  You should <strong>NEVER</strong> genrate a PropertyChanged event from within the ""getter"" for that property.  Example: in my SL data object of type ManufacturerData, I have a property called ""All"".  In the Get{} it checks to see if it has been loaded, if not it loads it like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class ManufacturersData : DataServiceAccessbase
{
    public ObservableCollection&lt;Web.Manufacturer&gt; All
    {
        get
        {
            if (!AllLoaded)
                LoadAllManufacturersAsync();
            return mAll;
        }
        private set
        {
            mAll = value;
            OnPropertyChanged(""All"");
        }
    }

    private void LoadAllManufacturersAsync()
    {
        if (!mCurrentlyLoadingAll)
        {
            mCurrentlyLoadingAll = true;

            // check to see if this component is loaded in local Isolated Storage, if not get it from the webservice
            ObservableCollection&lt;Web.Manufacturer&gt; all = IsoStorageManager.GetDataTransferObjectFromCache&lt;ObservableCollection&lt;Web.Manufacturer&gt;&gt;(mAllManufacturersIsoStoreFilename);
            if (null != all)
            {
                UpdateAll(all);
                mCurrentlyLoadingAll = false;
            }
            else
            {
                Web.SystemBuilderClient sbc = GetSystemBuilderClient();
                sbc.Manufacturers_GetAllCompleted += new EventHandler&lt;hookitupright.com.silverlight.data.Web.Manufacturers_GetAllCompletedEventArgs&gt;(sbc_Manufacturers_GetAllCompleted);
                sbc.Manufacturers_GetAllAsync(); ;
            }
        }
    }
    private void UpdateAll(ObservableCollection&lt;Web.Manufacturer&gt; all)
    {
       All = all;
       AllLoaded = true;
    }
    private void sbc_Manufacturers_GetAllCompleted(object sender, hookitupright.com.silverlight.data.Web.Manufacturers_GetAllCompletedEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.Error == null)
        {
            UpdateAll(e.Result.Records);
            IsoStorageManager.CacheDataTransferObject&lt;ObservableCollection&lt;Web.Manufacturer&gt;&gt;(e.Result.Records, mAllManufacturersIsoStoreFilename);
        }
        else
            OnWebServiceError(e.Error);
        mCurrentlyLoadingAll = false;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this code <strong>FAILS</strong> on a ""cache hit"" because it will generate an PropertyChanged event for ""All"" from within the All { Get {}} method which would normally cause the Binding System to call All {get{}} again...I copied this pattern of creating bindable silverlight data objects from a ScottGu blog posting way back and it has served me well overall, but stuff like this makes it pretty tricky.  Luckily the fix is simple.  Hope this helps someone else.</p>

<p>I know that for SQL Server, you can secure tables, and even columns against CRUD operations.  </p>

<pre><code> --// Logged in as 'sa'

 GRANT SELECT ON Person.Address(AddressID, AddressLine1) to Matt;
 GRANT UPDATE ON Person.Address(AddressLine1) to Matt;

 --// Logged in as 'Matt'
 SELECT * from Person.Address;                       --// Fail
 SELECT AddressID, AddressLine1 from Person.Address; --// Succeed
 UPDATE Person.Address SET AddressLine1 = '#____ 2700 Production Way'

<p>Features that are important to us:</p>

<ul>
<li>document sharing (specifications, manuals etc.)</li>
<li>discussion forums (I hate when important information is lost in the inbox)</li>
<li>issue tracking</li>
<li>Subversion integration would be nice to have but probably neither SharePoint, nor activeCollab currently support it, do they?</li>
</ul>

<p>Other things like time tracking are less important to us (although nice to have).</p>

<p>When I compare the two solutions, I see these strong points and drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Killer feature of SharePoint is Office integration. For instance, specification is much better authored in MS Word with styles, image drag&amp;drop etc. compared to a plain HTML textarea and some plain text format. We also use Outlook quite extensively so it would be good if we could leverage this tool.</li>
<li>activeCollab is web based and has a slick user interface which is important for adoption in our company (if our devs don't find the solution easy to work with, they will not use it). My boss also kind of likes easy solutions and activeCollab wins easily in this area.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding price, activeCollab is something like few hundreds dollars (reasonable one time cost) but I'm not too sure about SharePoint. If I'm right, the basic ""SharePoint Services"" version would be enough for us (I don't think we need the full MS Office SharePoint Server) and in that case, we need only Windows Server licence (which we already) and a SQL Server licence (would SQL Server Express work? or do we need at least workgroup edition?). This means that even SharePoint doesn't need to be too expensive if we go for the lowest edition.</p>

<p>Is there anyone who did the same comparison and could possibly provide more insight?</p>

<p>What I want to happen: The TextDisplay should occupy the main area of the control, 
with a vertical scrollbar if the height doesn't fit. The messages should wrap when they get too long horizontally.</p>

<p>The scrolling works, but now the messages don't wrap at the right-hand edge. they just cut off. It's not constraining the width, just hiding the HorizontalScrollBar. If I set HorizontalScrollBarVisibility=""Auto"" I can see them scrolling off to the right. How do i force it to wrap?</p>

<p>I noticed this happening at work recently because of a policy to achieve 100% code coverage. Code quality has been improving for sure but conversely the testers seem to be writing more lax test plans because 'well the code is fully unit tested'. Some logical bugs managed to slip through as a result. They were a REALLY BIG PAIN to debug because 'well the code is fully unit tested'.</p>

<p>I think that was partly because our tool did statement coverage only. Still, it could have been time better spent.</p>

<p>If anyone has other negative side effects of having a code coverage policy please share. I'd like to know what kind of other 'problems' are happening out there in the real-world.</p>

<p>To be more specific, I'm writing application which runs across many computers and sends/receives data from one to another. I feel more comfortable to have separate thread for each connected machine and task, like 1) sending data, 2) receiving data, 3) reestablishing connection when it is dropped. So, given that there are N nodes in cluster, each machine is going to have 3 threads for each of N-1 neighbours. Typically there will be 12 machines, which comes to 33 communication threads.</p>

<p>Most of those threads will be sleeping most of the time, so for optimization purposes I could reduce number of threads and give more job to each of them. Like, for example. reestablishing connection is responsibility of receiving thread. Or sending to all connected machines is done by single thread.</p>

<p>So is there any significant perfomance impact on having many sleeping threads?</p>

Here is part of the code:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class Page : UserControl

<li>How do I fix it?</li>

<p>Here is the situation:
I have a block of SQL commands coming as plain text. It might be one SQL commands or several. I need a way to split multiple SQL commands so I can run them one at a time. Microsoft SQL Management Studio does has this behavior out of box.</p>

<p>I'm trying to add this functionality to a PHP5/MySQL5 application running on Apache (Debian).</p>

<p>Some important points:</p>

<ol>
<li>I really do need to run them one at a time. Seriously.</li>
<li>I don't want to require the user to enter a semi-colon after each SQL statement.</li>
<li>SQL statements can be on one or multiple lines, so I can't wrap on LBs/CRs</li>
<li>It needs to support SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE at least.</li>
<li>It needs to support queries that are sub-selects</li>
<li>Neatly tabbed SQL needs to work</li>
<li>(In the interest of usable software) I do not want to force the user to enter in any kind of delimiter.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is an example block of SQL I need to split into two statements:</p>

<pre><code>select sMessage, 
(
    SELECT COUNT(sTag) FROM Tags WHERE ixTicket = note.ixTicket
) FROM note
select * from ticket
    WHERE (SELECT MAX(nCount) FROM Counter WHERE ixTicket = ticket.ixTicket) &gt; 5

Hibernate needs to set the accessibility of the field to true before it tries to read it which I can see having some <em>slight</em> overhead.  However wouldn't that be done at the Class-level in the scope of a Session or perhaps only once when the Configuration is read and SessionFactory is built?</p>

<p>and other sites say it does.</p>

<p>The reason I'm asking is we are flattening our WCF wsdl with a custom endpoint behavior extension (an implementation of IWsdlExportExtension/IEndpointBehavior) and using the flattened wsdl via Visual Studio 2008's Add Reference gives us compile errors as it is duplicating Types/Classes.  The reference is added without any errors.  SvcUtil, on the other hand, throws the duplicate class into a seperate namespace which fixes the build issue.</p>

<p>So SvcUtil works, but Visual Studio 2008 doesn't on some of our flatten wsdls.  We are fine with continueing to use svcutil if the Add Service Reference in Visual Studio doesn't work, but are wondering if anyone knows if there are any implications in doing so.  I couldn't find any evidence that we ""shouldn't"" be using svcutil, just that it isn't as easy as using the Add Service Reference in Visual Studio 2008.</p>

(This was borrowed from some example code I came across a while back.)</p>

<p>With an x86 binary, this works great.  With an x64 binary, though, StackWalk64() passes back bogus addresses.  <i>(The first time the API is called, the only blatantly bogus address value appears in <code>AddrReturn</code> ( == <code>0xFFFFFFFF'FFFFFFFE</code> -- aka StackWalk64()'s 3rd arg, the pseudo-handle returned by GetCurrentThread()).  If the API is called a second time, however, all <code>Addr</code>... variables receive bogus addresses.)</i>  This happens regardless of how <code>AddrFrame</code> is set:</p>

<ul>
<li>using either of the recommended x64 ""base/frame pointer"" CPU registers: <code>rbp</code> (= <code>0xf</code>), or <code>rdi</code> (= <code>0x0</code>)</li>
<li>using <code>rsp</code> <i>(didn't expect it to work, but tried it anyway)</i></li>
<li>setting <code>AddrPC</code> and <code>AddrStack</code> normally, but leaving <code>AddrFrame</code> zeroed out <i>(seen in other example code)</i></li>
<li>zeroing out all <code>Addr</code>... values, to let StackWalk64() fill them in from the passed-in CPU-register context <i>(seen in other example code)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>FWIW, the physical stack buffer's contents are also different on x64 vs. x86 (after accounting for different pointer widths &amp; stack buffer locations, of course).  Regardless of the reason, StackWalk64() should still be able to walk the call stack correctly -- heck, the debugger is still able to walk the call stack, and it appears to use StackWalk64() itself behind the scenes.  The oddity there is that the (correct) call stack reported by the debugger contains base-address &amp; return-address pointer values whose constituent bytes don't actually exist in the stack buffer (below or above the current stack pointer).</p>

<p><i>(FWIW #2: Given the stack-buffer strangeness above, I did try disabling ASLR (<code>/dynamicbase:no</code>) to see if it made a difference, but the binary still exhibited the same behavior.)</i></p>

<p>So.  Any ideas why this would work fine on x86, but have problems on x64?  Any suggestions on how to fix it?</p>

<p>The application is running on <code>http://localhost:51234/mvc</code></p>

<p>As anybody who has tried to use Fiddler for a site hosted on localhost knows there is an issue - windows won't forward localhost traffic through the proxy if you hit this link directly. You can work around this in <a href=""http://www.fiddlertool.com/Fiddler/help/hookup.asp#Q-LocalTraffic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">several ways</a>, such as my prefered way of using the URL <code>http://ipv4.fiddler:51234/aboutus/contact</code>. This works great.</p>

<p>The problem was I started doing AJAX using :</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;% using (Html.BeginForm()) { %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you view the source generated it has actually generated this :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;form
  action=""http://localhost:51234/aboutus/contact""
  method=""post""
  onsubmit=""Sys.Mvc.AsyncForm.handleSubmit(this, new Sys.UI.DomEvent(event), {
  insertionMode:
  Sys.Mvc.InsertionMode.replace,
  onFailure:
  Function.createDelegate(this,
  submitComments_failure), onSuccess:
  Function.createDelegate(this,
  submitComments_success) });""&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oops! </p>

<p>It generated <code>localhost</code> instead of <code>ipv4.fiddler:51234</code>. So of course when I run the AJAX query Fiddler doesn't see it. </p>

<p>In theory using the machine name should work, but the WebDev.WebServer won't respond if you try to hit directly the machine name <code>http://win-538lf:51234/aboutus/contact</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Fiddler] Connection to

  Text: No connection could be made

  refused it
  fe80::81fc:8f0f:457a:27df%12:51234</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a workaround for this? </p>

<p>is it possible to configure WebDev.WebServer to respond to the machine name? Or am I going to have to create a virtual directory or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fake host</a> ? I'd prefer not to do that, but i guess its not a big deal.</p>

The obvious way to do this is to use something like <code>select()</code>, but the only thing I can find in Java that does that is <code>Selector.select()</code>, which takes a <code>Channel</code>. It doesn't appear to be possible to get a <code>Channel</code> from an <code>InputStream</code> or <code>OutputStream</code> (<code>FileStream</code> has a  <code>getChannel()</code> method but that doesn't help here)</p>

<p>So, instead I wrote some code to poll all the streams:</p>

<pre><code>while( !out_eof || !err_eof )
{
    while( out_str.available() )
    {
        if( (bytes = out_str.read(buf)) != -1 )
        {
            // Do something with output stream
        }
        else
            out_eof = true;
    }
    while( err_str.available() )
    {
        if( (bytes = err_str.read(buf)) != -1 )
        {
            // Do something with error stream
        }
        else
            err_eof = true;
    }
    sleep(100);
}
</code></pre>

<p>which works, except that it never terminates. When one of the streams reaches end of file, <code>available()</code> returns zero so <code>read()</code> isn't called and we never get the -1 return that would indicate EOF.</p>

<p>One solution would be a non-blocking way to detect EOF. I can't see one in the docs anywhere. Alternatively is there a better way of doing what I want to do?</p>

<p>I see this question here:
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60302/starting-a-process-with-inherited-stdinstdoutstderr-in-java-6#60578"" title=""Processes with inherited stdin/stdout/stderr in Java"">link text</a>
and although it doesn't exactly do what I want, I can probably use that idea, of spawning separate threads for each stream, for the particular problem I have now. But surely that isn't the only way to do it? Surely there must be a way to read from multiple streams without using a thread for each?</p>

Minification is easy: set up the YUI Compressor, run an Ant task, and it spits out minified files, which we save beside the originals.</p>

<p>So we end up with the following directory structure somewhere inside our DocumentRoot:</p>

<pre>
/
   /js
      /min
         foo-min.js
         bar-min.js

      quux.js
   /css
      ...

<p>Now what we need is that Apache serve files from the <strong>min</strong> subdirectory, <em>and fallback to  serving uncompressed files</em>, if their minified versions are not available. The last issue is the one I cannot solve.</p>

<p>For example: suppose we have a request to <strong>example.com/js/foo.js</strong> — in this case Apache should send contents of <strong>/js/min/foo-min.js</strong>. There is no minified <strong>quux.js</strong>, so request to <strong>/js/quux.js</strong> returns <strong>/js/quux.js</strong> itself, not 404. Finally, if there is no <strong>/js/fred.js</strong>, it should end up with 404.</p>

<p>Actually, I'm setting build scripts in such a way that unminified files are not deployed on the production server, but this configuration still might be useful on an integration server and on development machines.</p>

Javed Hasan started arguing with him about his solution to the nolock situation on a high volume site.</p>

<p>Here, the problem trying to solve is, from the sql sense we need to use Select statements with NOLOCK or use SET TRANSACTION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED, otherwise at high volume rows in DB will be locked and cause errors.  The technology Omar used is Linq2Sql, so the question is how do we get this achieved in your C# data access code so the above does not happen?</p>

<p>Basically in the post, Omar comes to his solution by working and testing on real world site and with tools like SqlProfiler, whereas Javed Hasan comes to his solution with MSDN documents and Scott Hanselman's blog post etc.</p>

<p>Omar suggests using the following</p>

<pre><code>using (var db = new DropthingsDataContext2())
{
  db.Connection.Open();
  db.ExecuteCommand(""SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;"");

  var user = db.aspnet_Users.First();
  var pages = user.Pages.ToList();

<li>he did run into connection problem with his approach but he solved it, see his post.</li>
<li>more importantly he mentioned he tried the using ADO.NET Transaction way and even tried what Scott Hanselman wrote on his blog, but it is not working for high volume site, it degrades the performance quite a bit.  Omar said this ""System.Transactions has significant overhead. I have never been able to use it on a high volume website without making CPU go 100% and Req/sec come down to 1/10th. It's made for enterprise applications, not for high volume websites.""</li>

"564420","1","588732","","2009-02-19 08:42:32","","4","5446","<p>I have a <code>UITableView</code> with reorderable rows and I'm using the standard <code>UITableViewCell.text</code> property to display text.  When I tap Edit, move a row, tap Done, then tap the row, the built-in <code>UILabel</code> turns completely white (text and background) and opaque, and the blue shade to the cell doesn't show behind it.  What gives?  Is there something I should be doing that I'm not?  I have a hacky fix, but I want the real McCoy.</p>

<p>Here is how to reproduce it:</p>

<p>Starting with the standard ""Navigation-Based Application"" template in the iPhone OS 2.2.1 SDK:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open RootViewController.m</p></li>
<li><p>Uncomment <code>viewDidLoad</code>, and enable the Edit button:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Uncomment the following line to display an Edit button in the navigation bar for this view controller.
    self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = self.editButtonItem;
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Specify that the table has a few cells:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {
    return 4;
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In <code>tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code>, add a line to set the text property of a cell, and therefore to use the built-in UILabel subview:</p>

<pre><code>// Set up the cell...
cell.text = @""Test"";
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To enable reordering, uncomment <code>tableView:moveRowAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:</code>.  The default implementation is blank, which is fine in this case since the template doesn't include a data model.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure the project for the Simulator, OS 2.2.1, Build and Go.  When the app comes up, tap Edit, then slide any row to a new position, tap Done, and then tap each row one at a time.  Usually a tap will select a row, turn it blue, and turn its text white.  But a tap on the row that you just moved does that <em>and</em> leaves the UILabel's background color as white.  The result is a confusing white open space with blue strips on the edges.  Oddly enough, after the first bogus tap, another tap appears to correct the problem.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So far I have found a hack that fixes it, but I'm not happy with it.  It works by ensuring that the built-in <code>UILabel</code> is non-opaque and that it has no background color, immediately upon selection.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
    // hacky bugfix: when a row is reordered and then selected, the UILabel displays all crappy
    UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath];
    for (UIView *view in cell.contentView.subviews) {
        if ([[view class] isSubclassOfClass:[UILabel class]]) {
            ((UILabel *) view).backgroundColor = nil;
            view.opaque = NO;
        }
    }

    // regular stuff: only flash the selection, don't leave it blue forever
    [tableView deselectRowAtIndexPath:indexPath animated:YES];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This appears to work, but I don't expect it to be a good idea forever.  What is the Right Way to fix this?</p>

Generally the first draft is created by recording a test in the IDE. (This first step may be performed by QA staff.)  Then I refactor the generated C# code (extract constants, extract methods for repeated code, maybe repeat the test case with different data, etc). But the general flow of code for each test case remains reasonably close to the originally generated code.</p>

"258483","1","","","2008-11-03 12:26:39","","12","5452","<h2>Question</h2>

<p>I'm sure many of you have been faced by the challenge of localizing a database backend to an application. If you've not then I'd be pretty confident in saying that the odds of you having to do so in the future is quite large. I'm talking anout storing multiple translations of texts (and the same can be said for currency etc.) for your database entities.</p>

<p>For example the classic ""Category"" table might have a Name and a Description column which should be globalized. One way would be to do have a ""Text"" table for each of your entities and then do a join to retreive the values based on the provided language.</p>

<p>This leaves you with a lot of ""Text"" tables, one for each entity which you want to localize, with the addition of a TextType to distinguish between the various texts that it may store.</p>

<p>I'm curious if there are any, documented, best-practises / design patterns on implementing this kind of support into a SQL Server 2005/2008 datebase (I'm being specific about the RDBMS since it might contain supported keywords and such which helps with the implementation)?</p>

<h2>Thoughts on XML approach</h2>

<p>One idea I have been toying with (albeit only in my head so far) was to leverage the XML datatype introduced in SQL Server 2005. The idea was to make columns which should support localization, of the XML datatype (and bind a schema to it). The XML would contain the localized strings along with the language code / culture it was tied to.</p>

<p>Something along the lines of</p>

<pre><code>Product
ID (int, identity)
Name (XML ...)
Description (XML ...)
</code></pre>

<p>Then you would have something like this as the XML</p>

<pre><code>&lt;localization&gt;
  &lt;text culture=""sv-SE""&gt;Detta är ett namn&lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;text culture=""en-EN""&gt;This is a name&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/localization&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You could then do (This isn't production code so I'll use the *)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
From Product
Where Product.ID = 10
</code></pre>

<p>And you would get back the product with all localized texts which would mean you would have to do the extraction on the client-side. The biggest problem here is obviously the amount of extra data that you would have to return on each query, The benefits would be a cleaner design with no look-up tables, joins and so on. </p>

<p>Btw, what ever method I do end up using in my design I will still be using Linq To SQL (.NET Platform) to query the database (the XML approach should be a problem since it would return an XElement which could be interpreted client-side)</p>

<p>So suggestion on database localization design patterns, and possibly comments on the XML thought, would be very apprechiated.</p>

<ul>
<li>Begin with display $0.00</li>
<li>Tap 2 key: display $0.02 </li>
<li>Tap 5 key: display $0.25</li>

<p>Edit: On a side note, this is a progress bar in a toolStrip that also contains a label that gets updated with status bar text. Is there any way to get the label on the left side and the progress bar on the other instead of right next to each other on the left?</p>

and I intend to run the test on c code under Linux. </p>

<p>Now check and some well designed code and some test code can help me to verify 
that the basic functionality is correct, 
I mean it is quite easy to just look at the variables in and response back and then 
decide if a function is correct or not.</p>

<p>But let's say I want to test a dynamic memory structure with a lot off malloc and free, 
and it turns out that I can put data in and get correct data back out again.
But that does not prove that I have not broken some memory in the process, 
let's say I forgot to free half off the memory and lost the pointers (a classical memleak).
That code would probably pass most of the unit testing.</p>

<p>So now for the question: 
is it a good idea to run the entire unit test code with i.e. Valgrind and let him 
detect any malloc/free problems? (Or maybe compile in something like Electric Fence?)</p>

<p>It feels like a good idea, but I'm not sure what I'm getting myself into here.....</p>

<p>Thanks 
Johan</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Update:</em> Thanks Douglas and Jonathan, 
it seems like this is a good idea and something I should continue with :-)</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Valgrind is a fun tool, however the first memleaks I found doing this 
was in the test framework and not my own code (quite funny though).
So a tip to the rest out there is to verify that the unit test framework that you are using is not leaking, before turning your own code upside down.
An empty test case was all that was needed in my case, 
since then nothing but the unit test framework is running.</p>

<p>where UnitTestServiceLocator.java:85 is the line of ctx.lookup(jndiname);</p>

<p>Why would the simple test pass but the more complex test fail ?  Both use a classpath that points to the lib directory which is populated with the jms and mq jars (among other things).</p>

<p>The complex test matches what the library will fill in but using magic as the passed in values.  The library code has a ""few"" more lines that extract the magic values from the preferences file(s).
What am I missing?  The library code will work on the server but fail on my laptop (when developing).</p>

<p>I even created another jndi path - just in case the first test was mucking up the second.  Still fails.</p>

<p>Since I don't have any desire (or permission to change the library code), the call to InitialContext(X); is that way BECAUSE that's the way the library does it.  I've seen the other examples with nothing passed with InitialContext and I'm confused why that is better.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
I've created a jndi_test project on linux java1.5 and that successfully runs the failing test.  Taking the same source and moving it to the windows environment - the test fails.  There are a few changes to the classpath due to the fact that there is no C drive on linux but the data files are the same.  (hmm delimiter issue ?)</p>

<p>I've also found out that I've got problems with that library IF i'm going to run it on 1.5, but that's a side issue.</p>

<ul>
<li>.NET development using Visual Studio 2005/2008</li>
<li>TortoiseSVN client</li>
</ul>

<p>I've only primarily worked with Visual Source Safe and SourceGear Vault source control systems.  In each, I map the root of the repository to a local working directory.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>$/  --&gt;  C:\source
</code></pre>

<p>As long as the local directory exists, I've got my ""working copy"" (svn) or ""working folder"" (VSS) set up.</p>

<p>To work on a new project that is already in the source code repository I need to ""get the latest"" (VSS) version of that project's directory.</p>

<p>When I go into any child directory in the repository and ""Get Latest"" (i.e. svn checkout) the client will automatically create the complete directory hierarchy for me, mirroring the structure on my local disk.  Thus when I get latest of</p>

<pre><code>$/foo/bar/project1
</code></pre>

<p>it is created on the drive at</p>

<pre><code>C:\source\foo\bar\project1
</code></pre>

<p>In subversion, when I check out a directory, I must specify the working copy directory location.  If I want to properly mirror my working copy directory structure to match the repository I have to either manually construct every child directory in the path or do a checkout of the repository root to the working copy root, getting everything in the repository.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to get a repository directory down in the hierarchy such that it will be created in a matching local working copy directory structure without all the manual intervention?</strong></p>

<p>This isn't a problem with a small repository, but in most cases, I don't need a large percentage of the source repository.  It's imperative that the physical structure is maintained in order for file references to projects and resources not to break.  Plus the disk cost of SVN is twice the actual source size given all the working base copies of the files.</p>

<p>I'm currently using Tortoise.  Is it possible there are other SVN clients that will do what I'm looking for?</p>

<p>Anyway, the problem I'm having is with an application that's using a custom moduleloader.  That moduleloader has been compiled into an swc and the moduleloader is being instantiated via its namespace.  This all works perfectly fine.  The problem I'm encountering is specific to mx:button controls used within modules.  For whatever reason, their labels are being truncated so, for example, Sign In is showing up with an ellipsis, as Sign ...</p>

<p>After quite a bit of fooling around I have been able to establish the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>This problem only seems to occur within modules.  If a button control is used in the main mxml, the label does not get truncated.</li>
<li>The button control whose label is being truncated does not have a width specified (setting its width to 100%  or a specific pixel width doesn't fix the issue)</li>
<li>The button control is using the default padding (messing with the padding by setting left and right to 5 or any other value doesn't help matters either).</li>
<li>We are not using any embedded fonts so I've ruled that out as a possibility as well.</li>
<li>mx:CheckBox and mx:LinkButton are equally impacted by this problem although mx:CheckBox also seems to not want to show its checkbox, it just shows the truncated label.</li>
</ol>

<p>A potential side affect of this is that attaching a dataprovider to mx:ComboBox causes the combobox control to throw a drawing error but I'm not entirely certain that it's related to the above problem.</p>

<p>One interesting thing I did find while perusing the net for an answer was a mention of fontContext and its relationship to IFlexModuleFactory.  There's no specification for fontContext within our implementation of moduleloader so I'm not entirely certain if this could be the issue.  In any case, if anyone has any ideas, it would be hugely appreciated.  On the other hand, if you know exactly what ails me and can provide me with an answer, I might just wet myself with excitement.  It's late. I'm tired. I NEED my Flex app to play nice.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>--Anne</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  To clarify what I'm looking for with this question, I really just need to know the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Could this issue be caused by a namespace conflict?</li>
<li>What else can potentially override the default behavior of labels if no CSS has been implemented?</li>
<li>Has anyone encountered a problem with inheritance being lost while using a custom implementation of moduleloader?</li>
<li>Has anyone encountered this problem or a similar problem with or without using moduleloader?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not sharing any code with this question simply because I'd have to share the entire application and, unfortunately, I can't do that.  Again, I'm not looking for the end all, be all solution, just some suggestions of things to look out for if anyone has any ideas.</p>

However, <a href=""http://www.iceincusa.com/16csp/content/16_smoke/smkrgt.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> by Ron Morrison and Grady Booch makes me think differently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The desired strategy would be to bring each unit in one at a time, perform an extensive regression test, correct any defects and then proceed to the next unit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same document also says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As soon as a small number of units are added, a test version is generated and ""smoke tested,"" wherein a small number of tests are run to gain confidence that the integrated product will function as expected. The intent is neither to thoroughly test the new unit(s) nor to completely regression test the overall system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When describing smoke testing, the authors say this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is also important that the Smoke Test perform a quick check of the entire system, not just the new component(s).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've never seen ""extensive"" and ""regression test"" used together nor a regression test described as ""completely regression test the overall system"". Regression tests are supposed to be as light and quick as possible. And the definition of smoke test is what I learned a regression test was.</p>

<p>I'm wanting to either save a new instance (which will update with the ID which may later be used) or retrieve an existing instance that matches some logic and update that, save it then change the reference of the new instance to point to the existing one.</p>

<p>Code may make it clearer:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void BeforeSave(Log entity)
{
    var newLog = entity;

    var existingLog = (from log in repository.All()
                           where log.Stuff == newLog.Stuff 
                                 &amp;&amp; log.Id != newLog.Id

}
</code></pre>

<p>It's the fact that I would be adding it in only for one child (so far) of the base class that prevents me using an overload (due to the fact I would have to duplicate the Save method). I also have the problem whereby I need to force them to use the ref version in this instance otherwise things won't work as expected.</p>

This is one of my most-visited questions, and yet I still haven't really found a satisfactory solution for my project. One idea I read in an answer to another question is to create a tool which can build solutions 'on the fly' for projects that you pick from a list. I have yet to try that though.</p>

<hr>

<p>How do you structure a very large application?</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple smallish projects/assemblies in one big solution? </li>
<li>A few big projects?</li>
<li>One solution per project?</li>
</ul>

<p>And how do you manage dependencies in the case where you don't have one solution.
Note: I'm looking for advice based on experience, not answers you found on Google (I can do that myself).</p>

<p>I'm currently working on an application which has upward of 80 dlls, each in its own solution. Managing the dependencies is almost a full time job. There is a custom in-house 'source control' with added functionality for copying dependency dlls all over the place. Seems like a sub-optimum solution to me, but is there a better way? Working on a solution with 80 projects would be pretty rough in practice, I fear.</p>

<p>(Context: winforms, not web)</p>

<p>EDIT: <em>(If you think this is a different question, leave me a comment)</em></p>

<p>It seems to me that there are interdependencies between:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project/Solution structure for an application</li>
<li>Folder/File structure</li>
<li>Branch structure for source control (if you use branching)</li>

<p>Let's start by saying that I know that you can step over with F8, and that you can run to a certain line with f4.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>function TMyClass.DoStuff():Integer;
begin
  // do some stuff
  bla();
end;

procedure TMyClass.Foo()
begin
  if DoStuff()=0 then // press F7 when entering this line
    beep;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>Example: I want to step into method DoStuff() by pressing F7, but instead of going there, I first end up in FastMM4.FastGetMem(), which is a massive blob of assembly code that obviously I'm not interested in at the moment.</p>

<p>There are several ways to go about this, and I don't like any of them:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add a breakpoint on ""<em>bla</em>"" (almost useless if you only want to step into DoStuff on special occasions, like iteration 23498938);</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of pressing F7, manually move the cursor to ""<em>bla</em>"", and press F4 (Works for this simple example. In practice, it doesn't); </p></li>
<li><p>In case of FastMM: temporarily disable fastmm;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Is there any way to hint the IDE that I'm <strong>never</strong> interested into stepping into a certain block of code, or do I always have to set extra breakpoints or use F4 to try to avoid this?</p>

<p>I'm hoping for some magic compiler directive like {$NODEBUG BEGIN/END} or something like that.</p>

<p>In most cases being able to exclude entire units would be fine-grained enough for me, but being able to avoid certain methods or even lines of code would be even better.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that all the keys in the dictionary appear to share the same list, and each run simply appends to it. Is there any way to generate a unique empty list for each key using <code>fromkeys</code>? If not, is there another way to do this without generating the resulting dictionary by hand?</p>

We would like to share this stack with another web application, to avoid having multiple instances of the same objects.</p>

<p>We have looked into several approaches; exposing the objects using JMX or JNDI, or using EJB3. </p>

<p>The different approaches all have their issues, and we are looking for a lightweight method. </p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to solve this?</p>

<p>Edit: I have received comments requesting me to elaborate a bit, so here goes:</p>

<p>The main problem we want to solve is that we want to have only one instance of Hibernate. This is due to problems with invalidation of Hibernate's 2nd level cache when running several client applications working with the same datasource. Also, the business/DAO/Hibernate stack is growing rather large, so not duplicating it just makes more sense.</p>

<p>First, we tried to look at how the business layer alone could be exposed to other web apps, and Spring offers JMX wrapping at the price of a tiny amount of XML. However, we were unable to bind the JMX entities to the JNDI tree, so we couldn't lookup the objects from the web apps.</p>

<p>Then we tried binding the business layer directly to JNDI. Although Spring didn't offer any method for this, using JNDITemplate to bind them was also trivial. But this led to several new problems: 1) Security manager denies access to RMI classloader, so the client failed once we tried to invoke methods on the JNDI resource. 2) Once the security issues were resolved, JBoss threw IllegalArgumentException: object is not an instance of declaring class. A bit of reading reveals that we need stub implementations for the JNDI resources, but this seems like a lot of hassle (perhaps Spring can help us?)</p>

<p>We haven't looked too much into EJB yet, but after the first two tries I'm wondering if what we're trying to achieve is at all possible. </p>

<p>To sum up what we're trying to achieve: One JBoss instance, several web apps utilizing one stack of business objects on top of DAO layer and Hibernate.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>If you don't know, unison is a file synchronization tool, it runs an ""ssh"" command to connect to a remote server, but there's no ssh.exe for windows; there's plink, which is very close but not close enough (it doesn't behave like unison expects it to), so people usually make wrappers around it, <a href=""http://www.wischik.com/lu/programmer/unison-ssh.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">like this one</a>.</p>

<p>one of the problems is that unison expects the password prompt to print to stderr (but plink prints it to stdout, and causes unison to be confused), so I thought, well, should be simple enough, hack my thru plink's code and make it print the prompt to stdout. so I hacked my way through and did that.</p>

<p>Next problem: I can't respond to the prompt!! no matter what I type, it has no effect.</p>

<p>the code for getting input is roughly like this:</p>

<pre><code>hin = GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE);
....
r = ReadFile(hin, .....);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why it's done this way, but I'm not an expert in designing command line tools for windows, so what do I know! But I figure something is missing in setting up the input handle.</p>

<p>I looked at the source code for the <a href=""http://www.wischik.com/lu/programmer/unison-ssh.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">above wrapper tool</a> and I see this: 
<code>hconin=CreateFile(""CONIN$"",GENERIC_READ|GENERIC_WRITE,FILE_SHARE_READ,0,OPEN_EXISTING,0,0)</code></p>

<p>and I try it (just for the heck of it)</p>

<pre><code>hin=CreateFile(""CONIN$"",GENERIC_READ|GENERIC_WRITE,FILE_SHARE_READ,0,OPEN_EXISTING,0,0);
....
r = ReadFile( hin ...... )
</code></pre>

<p>and surprisingly it works! I can now respond to the prompt!</p>

<p>Why is this? what is ""CONIN$""? and why is it different from the <code>STD_INPUT_HANDLE</code>?</p>

<p>I can sort of ""guess"" that <code>FILE_SHARE_READ</code> and <code>OPEN_EXISTING</code> are playing a role in this (since ssh is being run from within another process), but I want to understand what's going on here, and make sure that this code doesn't have some unwanted side effects or security holes or something scary like that!</p>

<p>I have a program written that parses an Excel file and it works just fine.  I use the following to get into the file:</p>

<pre><code>string FileToConvert = Server.MapPath(""."") + ""\\App_Data\\CP-ARFJN-FLAG.XLS"";
string connectionString = ""Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source="" + FileToConvert + "";Extended Properties=Excel 8.0;"";
OleDbConnection connection = new OleDbConnection(connectionString);
connection.Open();
//this next line assumes that the file is in default Excel format with Sheet1 as the first sheet name, adjust accordingly
OleDbDataAdapter adapter = new OleDbDataAdapter(""SELECT * FROM [CP-ARFJN-FLAG$]"", connection);
</code></pre>

<p>and this works just fine.  But when I try it on the actual file (it is supplied to me by another program) I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>System.Data.OleDb.OleDbException: External table is not in the expected format. at System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnectionInternal..ctor(OleDbConnectionString constr, OleDbConnection connection) at System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnectionFactory.CreateConnection(DbConnectionOptions options, Object poolGroupProviderInfo, DbConnectionPool pool, DbConnection owningObject) at System.Data.ProviderBase.DbConnectionFactory.CreateNonPooledConnection(DbConnection owningConnection, DbConnectionPoolGroup poolGroup) at System.Data.ProviderBase.DbConnectionFactory.GetConnection(DbConnection owningConnection) at System.Data.ProviderBase.DbConnectionClosed.OpenConnection(DbConnection outerConnection, DbConnectionFactory connectionFactory) at System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection.Open() at wetglobe.Page_Load(Object sender, EventArgs e)
</code></pre>

<p>BUT, this is where I think the problem lies.  If I take that file, and save it with my local Excel, first I get this popup:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CP-ARFJN-FLAG.XLS may contain features
  that are not compatible with Text (Tab

  workbook in this format?</p>

  <li>To preserve the features, click No. 
  Ten save a copy in the latest Excel
  format.</li>
  <li>To see what might be lost, click
  Help.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>If I click No and then save it as the current Excel format, the program will then work fine.</p>

<p>So I am assuming this is saved in some crazy old Excel format?</p>

<p>I suppose my questions would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can I tell what Excel version
saved this?</li>
<li>How can I parse it in its current
state?</li>
<li>-or- Can I programatically save it as a newer version?</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope that is clear... Thank you.</p>

<p>Here dateStr is a string entered by the user in a form, in the format yyyy-mm-dd. Now the behavior of Timestamp.valueOf is such that it converts non-existent dates into appropriate proper dates. Say 31st June 2008 into 01st July 2008. </p>

<p>I have measuring probes which need to register with a central server. Each probe should have a different physical address. To register, they should call (via a web service):</p>

I need to somehow alert the probe if it's trying to register itself using a physical address that's already taken.</p>

<p>The way I see it, I got a few possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Throw a SoapException containing the information. However, a string::message isn't really that easy to do programmatic checks on.</li>
<li>Use some sort of value-class as a return parameter (or even simpler, an enum). If I do this, I guess I had to manually serialize / deserialize the class on the server/client?</li>

<ul>
<li>Drag events are events that take place when the user is dragging an object.  This is ""proper"" OS dragging, eg:  hiliting some text and dragging it, or even dragging in something from outside of the browser.</li>
<li>While dragging, as far as I can tell, no other browser events will be fired.  (onmouseover is ignored, for example).  The only events that work are drag events.</li>
<li>In all modern browsers, onDragEnter and onDragOver appear to work...  but firefox lacks ""onDragLeave.""</li>
<li>For dropping, FF uses ""onDragDrop"" while IE and others use ""onDrop"" while Safari doesn't appear to support it.</li>
<li>Events only seem to work on ""droppable"" elements, like textarea and text.  On other elements only <em>some</em> events work.</li>
<li>Various other quirks for each browser that I don't even want to go over.</li>
<li>There is very little documented about these events.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I <strong>must</strong> use actual drag+drop, and cannot simulate it.</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is there a way to detect ""ondragleave"" or similar in FF?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there a way to detect ""ondragdrop"" or similar in Safari?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do you have anything to add about Drag + Drop?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a quick and dirty template demonstrating drag and drop events:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    addEvent = function(obj, eventname, fn){
        if (document.addEventListener) obj.addEventListener(eventname, fn, false);
        else obj.attachEvent('on'+eventname, fn);
    }

    window.onload = function(){
        var logger = document.getElementById(""logger"");
        var log = function(str){ logger.value = str + logger.value; }

        //log a variety of drag events for the textarea
        var obj = document.getElementById(""tarea"");
        var events = [""dragenter"",""dragover"",""dragout"",""dragleave"",""dragdrop"",""drop""];
        for (var i=0; i&lt;events.length; i++){
            (function(event){//create a closure to remove variable scope
                addEvent(obj, event, function(){ log(""textarea: "" + event + ""\n""); });
            })(events[i]);
        }

        //log events on the div
        obj = document.getElementById(""div"");
        events = [""mouseover"",""mouseout"",""mouseup"",""mousedown"",""click"",""dblclick"",
                ""dragenter"",""dragover"",""dragout"",""dragleave"",""dragdrop"",""drop""];
        for (var i=0; i&lt;events.length; i++){
            (function(event){//create a closure to remove variable scope
                addEvent(obj, event, function(){ log(""div: "" + event + ""\n""); });
            })(events[i]);
        }
    }
&lt;/script&gt;

It appears there is no easy way to send the same multiple values for the same key for postfields. Most of the workarounds I have come across for this have involved creating the URL encoded post fields by hand tag=foo&amp;tag=bar&amp;tag=baz) instead of using the associative array version of CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS.</p>

<p>It seems like a pretty common thing to need to support so I feel like I must have missed something. Is this really the only way to handle multiple values for the same key?</p>

<p>While this workaround might be considered workable (if not really annoying), my main problem is that I need to be able to do multiple values for the same key and also support file upload. As far as I can tell, file upload more or less requires to use the associate arravy version of CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS. So I feel like I am stuck.</p>

<p>I have <a href=""http://curl.haxx.se/mail/curlphp-2008-12/0009.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">posted</a> about this problem in more detail on the cURL PHP mailing list in the hopes that someone there has some ideas about this.</p>

<p>Suggestions or hints on where I can look for more information on this are greatly appreciated!</p>

"13014992","1","","","2012-10-22 14:42:52","","3","5496","<p>I have a VB.NET 2008 program that accesses a Siebel web service defined by a WSDL and using the SOAP protocol.</p>

<p>The Siebel web service requires that a header containing the username, password and session type be included with the service request, but the header is not defined in the WSDL.</p>

<p>So, when I test the WSDL using the soapUI utility, the request as defined by the WSDL looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" xmlns:lov=""http://www.siebel.com/xml/LOVService"" xmlns:lis=""http://www.siebel.com/xml/ListQuery""&gt;
&lt;soapenv:Header/&gt;
   &lt;soapenv:Body&gt;
      &lt;lov:EAILOVGetListOfValues_Input&gt;
         &lt;lis:ListsQuery&gt;
            &lt;lis:ListQuery&gt;
               &lt;lis:Active&gt;Y&lt;/lis:Active&gt;
               &lt;lis:LanguageCode&gt;ENU&lt;/lis:LanguageCode&gt;
               &lt;lis:Type&gt;CUT_ACCOUNT_TYPE&lt;/lis:Type&gt;
            &lt;/lis:ListQuery&gt;
         &lt;/lis:ListsQuery&gt;
      &lt;/lov:EAILOVGetListOfValues_Input&gt;
   &lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;
&lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But the above does not work because it contains an empty header that is missing user and session credentials. It only works if I manually replace <code>&lt;soapenv:Header/&gt;</code> with a header containing the username, password, and session type as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" xmlns:lov=""http://www.siebel.com/xml/LOVService"" xmlns:lis=""http://www.siebel.com/xml/ListQuery""&gt;
&lt;soapenv:Header&gt;
  &lt;UsernameToken xmlns=""http://siebel.com/webservices""&gt;TESTUSER&lt;/UsernameToken&gt;
  &lt;PasswordText xmlns=""http://siebel.com/webservices""&gt;TESTPASSWORD&lt;/PasswordText&gt;
  &lt;SessionType xmlns=""http://siebel.com/webservices""&gt;None&lt;/SessionType&gt;
&lt;/soapenv:Header&gt;
   &lt;soapenv:Body&gt;
      &lt;lov:EAILOVGetListOfValues_Input&gt;
         &lt;lis:ListsQuery&gt;
            &lt;lis:ListQuery&gt;
               &lt;lis:Active&gt;Y&lt;/lis:Active&gt;

               &lt;lis:Type&gt;CUT_ACCOUNT_TYPE&lt;/lis:Type&gt;
            &lt;/lis:ListQuery&gt;
         &lt;/lis:ListsQuery&gt;
      &lt;/lov:EAILOVGetListOfValues_Input&gt;
   &lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;
&lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is that I cannot sort out how to translate the above into VB.NET 2008 code.</p>

<p>I have no problem importing the WSDL into Visual Studio 2008, defining the service in VB code and referencing the web service methods. However, I cannot sort out how to define the web service in VB such that the updated header in included in the web service request instead of the empty header. Consequently all my service requests from VB fail.</p>

<p>I can define a class that inherits from the SoapHeader class...</p>

<pre><code>Public Class MySoapHeader : Inherits System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHeader
    Public Username As String
    Public Password As String
    Public SessionType As String
End Class
</code></pre>

<p>...but how do I include this header in the SOAP request made from VB?</p>

<p>The sample code I am using to test this is a simple form with a button and a list box.</p>

<pre><code>Public Class Form1

    Private Sub btnGetLOV_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnGetLOV.Click

        Dim MyService As New wsLOV.EAILOVPortClient

        Dim MyInput As New wsLOV.EAILOVGetListOfValues_Input
        Dim MyParams(0) As wsLOV.ListQuery
        Dim temp As New wsLOV.ListQuery

        Dim MyResult As New wsLOV.EAILOVGetListOfValues_Output

        temp.Active = ""Y""
        temp.Type = ""CUT_ACCOUNT_TYPE""
        temp.LanguageCode = ""ENU""
        MyParams(0) = temp

        MyInput.ListsQuery = MyParams

        Dim MyRequest As New wsLOV.EAILOVGetListOfValuesRequest(MyInput)
        MyResult = MyService.EAILOVGetListOfValues(MyInput)


    End Sub

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>The code fails on the last line of the subroutine with a message indicating that the request has not been authenticated (Error Code: 10944642 Error Message: Error: Inbound SOAP Message - Session Token is missing or invalid or has expired) which is the same error I get in soapUI when I leave off the header containing username, password, and session type.</p>

<p>I believe I need to add the header to the endpoint (per <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731749.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731749.aspx</a> and <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.configuration.serviceendpointelement.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.configuration.serviceendpointelement.aspx</a>) but I am not sure how to do this in VB.</p>

<p>The most curious thing about this is that each of the individual statements in the trigger works on its own. It's almost as though inserted is a one-off table that infects temporary tables if you try to move inserted into one of them.</p>
